title: "Fetching Polygon Logs for an Address from a Block using `eth_getTransactionReceiptsByBlock` and web3.py"
description: "Using the web3.py library, this tool fetches transaction logs from the Polygon blockchain for a given Ethereum address in a specific block. It aids in efficient retrieval and analysis of transaction activities, ideal for debugging and monitoring."

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Overview">

With the web3.py library, this script connects to the Polygon blockchain via a Chainstack RPC node running BOR. It's designed to fetch transaction logs from a particular block, specifically targeting logs related to a predefined Ethereum address. Leveraging the `eth_getTransactionReceiptsByBlock` method, exclusive to the BOR node, this code provides a streamlined way to extract and display transaction details, making it a handy tool for developers and analysts monitoring specific addresses on the Polygon network.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Environment setup">

Create a new directory for your project, then install the web3.py library:

`pip install web3`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Get your Chainstack endpoint">

You will need a Chainstack account and a Polygon full node to run this code.

1. [Sign up with Chainstack](https://console.chainstack.com/user/account/create).
2. [Deploy a node](https://docs.chainstack.com/docs/manage-your-networks#join-a-public-network).
3. [View node access and credentials](https://docs.chainstack.com/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).

<Accordion title="The logic">

The script connects to the Polygon network using the `web3.py` library and targets a specific block. It fetches transaction receipts from this block and sifts through them to identify transactions related to a predefined Ethereum address. Relevant details from these transactions, including logs, are then extracted and displayed, providing a snapshot of the address's activities within that block. Error handling mechanisms ensure smooth operation and user feedback in case of issues.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create a new file">

In your directory, create a new file named `main.py`.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Imports and Constants">

The script starts by importing necessary modules and defining constants.

```python main.py
from pprint import pprint
from web3 import Web3

NODE_URL = "YOUR_CHAINSTACK_POLYGON_RPC" # This needs to be running on BOR and the eth_getTransactionReceiptsByBlock method is only available there
ADDRESS = '0x371ef444a12b951b492f19ed6343a8aac6fdca55' # Edit with the address you need to monitor
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Utility Functions">

These functions handle conversions between decimal and hexadecimal formats.

```python main.py
def decimal_to_hex(decimal_number):
    """Convert a decimal number to its hexadecimal representation."""
    return hex(decimal_number)

def hex_to_decimal(hex_string):
    """Convert a hexadecimal string to its decimal representation."""
    return int(hex_string, 16)
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Log Extraction">

This function sifts through block receipts to find and print logs related to the specified Ethereum address.

```python main.py
def get_logs_for_address(address, block_receipts):
    """
    Fetch and print logs for a given Ethereum address from the provided block receipts.
    """
    receipts = block_receipts.get('result', [])
    for receipt in receipts:
        if receipt['to'] == address:
            print('Block number:' , hex_to_decimal(receipt['blockNumber']))
            print('Transaction hash:', receipt['transactionHash'])
            print('To:' , receipt['to'], '\n')
            print('Logs:')
            pprint(receipt['logs'])
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Main Function">

The `main` function serves as the primary driver of the script.

It establishes a connection to the Polygon node, fetches transaction receipts for a specific block, and then invokes the log extraction function.

```python main.py
def main():
    web3 = Web3.HTTPProvider(NODE_URL)

    block = 45941582
    hex_block = decimal_to_hex(block)

    try:
        block_receipts = web3.make_request('eth_getTransactionReceiptsByBlock', [hex_block])
        get_logs_for_address(ADDRESS, block_receipts)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Script Execution">

This conditional ensures that the main function is executed only when the script is run directly and not when imported as a module.

```python main.py
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Run the code">

Now add your Chainstack node URL and run the script:

```shell
python3 main.py
```

The script will print logs for any transaction going to the specified address.
