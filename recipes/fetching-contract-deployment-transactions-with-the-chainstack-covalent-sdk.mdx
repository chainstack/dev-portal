description: "Querying the Chainstack Covalent SDK to return a list of contracts deployed by a specified address."

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Overview">

This code snippet is designed to fetch contract deployment transactions for a specified wallet address on a given blockchain network using Chainstack's Covalent integration SDK. It then retrieves the contract address for each transaction and prints the transaction hash and contract address.

In short, this script will fetch a full list of contracts deployed by a specified address.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Environment setup">

Install node.js in case it's not yet installed.

Create a new directory for your project, then install the web3.js library:
`npm install web3`

Additionally, install the Chainstack Covalent SDK:
`npm install chainstack-covalent-sdk`

```js JavaScript
const { ChainstackApi } = require('chainstack-covalent-sdk');
const { Web3 } = require('web3');
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Get your Chainstack API key and endpoint">

You'll need both an endpoint for the blockchain you'd like to query, as well as a Chainstack platform API key for authentication within the Chainstack Covalent SDK.

1. Retrieve your API key by navigating to your Chainstack account settings, then API keys. Generate a new key, and place that in the `ChainstackApi` constructor.

> Remember you will need to purchase the Chainstack-Covalent integration from the [Chainstack Marketplace](https://console.chainstack.com/marketplace/).

2. Head over to the Chainstack console and deploy a node for your query chain. Copy the corresponding HTTPS endpoint and paste it into `web3`.

```js JavaScript
const web3 = new Web3('CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT');

const chainstackApi = new ChainstackApi('CHAINSTACK_API_KEY');
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Initializing the parameters">

To begin, you'll need to create a variable that holds the parameters of our SDK method call. In this case, you'll need to define `chainName` and `walletAddress`.

`chainName` should be formatted as 'chain-network', with chain referring to the name of the blockchain in question, and network referring to the mainnet, testnet, etc. For example, 'eth-sepolia', or 'base-mainnet'

`walletAddress` should be defined as a string containing the address of the wallet you'd like to query the contract deployments of.

```js JavaScript
const fetchContractDeploymentTransactionsParams = {
  chainName: "chain-network", // ex: base-mainnet
  walletAddress: "0x03d4C4b1B115c068Ef864De2e21E724a758892A2"
};
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Creating the handler function">

Now, with your parameters defined, we'll need to create the response handler function to retrieve additional information, such as the address of the deployed contract.

This function will leverage the RPC node previously defined to run a `getTransactionReceipt` request on the provided transaction hash.

```js JavaScript
async function getContractDeploymentDetails(txHash) {
  const txReceipt = await web3.eth.getTransactionReceipt(txHash);
  return txReceipt.contractAddress;
}
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Calling the method and printing the response">

Now we'll need to define the `main()` function. This function will contain the `fetchContractDeploymentTransactions` call to the Chainstack Covalent SDK. Within this call, we'll pass in the parameters defined earlier.

This will result in a response containing a list of relevant transactions, in which we'll then parse through in the `for` loop. For each transaction, we'll run it through the handler, `getContractDeploymentDetails`, then print out the hash & contract address.

```js JavaScript
async function main() {
  const contractDeploymentTransactions = await chainstackApi.fetchContractDeploymentTransactions(fetchContractDeploymentTransactionsParams);
  for (const transaction of contractDeploymentTransactions) {
    const address = await getContractDeploymentDetails(transaction.tx_hash);
    console.log(`Transaction hash: ${transaction.tx_hash}`);
    console.log(`Contract address: ${address}`);
  }
}

main();
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Understanding the response">

The response here will be dependent upon the address you decide to query, but you should expect to see multiple strings printed to the console following the order of: "Details for transaction `tx`", then "Contract Address: `address`".

The transaction hash will directly point to the transaction in which the contract was deployed, and the contract address refers to the address of the deployed contract itself.

Due to the computationally intensive nature of this method, responses may take a few seconds.
