<Accordion title="Overview">
This recipe shows how you can use the solana/web3.js library to send transactions programmatically using a Solana Chainstack node.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Environment setup">

Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if it is not installed yet.

Create a new directory for your project, then install the `solana/web3.js` and `bs58` libraries:

`npm install --save @solana/web3.js bs58`

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Get your Chainstack endpoint">

To run this code, you will need a Chainstack account and a Solana Elastic node.

1. [Sign up with Chainstack](https://console.chainstack.com/user/account/create).
2. [Deploy a node](https://docs.chainstack.com/docs/manage-your-networks#join-a-public-network).
3. [View node access and credentials](https://docs.chainstack.com/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="The code">

This script starts by importing the necessary libraries.

@solana/web3.js is the Solana JavaScript API, which provides the functionality needed to interact with the Solana blockchain. bs58 is a library for encoding and decoding data in base58, a binary-to-text encoding often used in cryptocurrencies.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Connection and accounts setup">

The `connection` const establishes a connection to the Solana blockchain using a Chainstack endpoint.

The next few lines set up two accounts. The first account is created from a private key. The second account is a new account that's generated on the fly to be a fresh recipient account.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="The transfer function">

This is an `async` function to transfer a certain amount of Lamports, the smallest unit of the SOL token in Solana, from the first to the second account. In this case, it's sending 0.001 SOL (LAMPORTS\_PER\_SOL \* 0.001).

It then sends the transaction and waits for confirmation.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Run the code">

Now you can get your endpoint and paste it into the connection const.

Then you can run it with `node YOUR_SCRIPT_NAME`

The transaction has been sent successfully if you don't get any errors in the console.

<RequestExample>
```js index.js
const web3 = require("@solana/web3.js");
const bs58 = require("bs58");

const connection = new web3.Connection('YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT');

const privateKey = new Uint8Array(bs58.decode('YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY'));
const account = web3.Keypair.fromSecretKey(privateKey);
const account2 = web3.Keypair.generate();

(async () => {
  const transaction = new web3.Transaction().add(
    web3.SystemProgram.transfer({
      fromPubkey: account.publicKey,
      toPubkey: account2.publicKey,
      lamports: web3.LAMPORTS_PER_SOL * 0.001,
    }),
  );
  const signature = await web3.sendAndConfirmTransaction(
    connection,
    transaction,
    [account],
  );
})();
```
