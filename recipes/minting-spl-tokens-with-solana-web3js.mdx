<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Overview">

solana-web3.js (`@solana/web3.js`) is a powerful library that exists as a key tool within the typical Solana developer's tech stack.

Having already covered sending a simple transaction with solana-web3.js, we're going to dive into a slightly more complex task: **Minting an SPL token natively in solana-web3.js**
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Environment setup">

If you haven't already, ensure node.js is installed.

You'll need to install three main dependencies here:

1. `@solana/web3.js`, self-explanatory, this is what you'll be using to connect and interact with Solana.
2. `@solana/spl-token` for interacting with the Solana token program.
3. `bs58` for converting a traditional string private key to a `Uint8Array` in the account definition process.

```js index.js
const solanaWeb3 = require('@solana/web3.js');
const splToken = require('@solana/spl-token');
const bs58 = require("bs58");
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Connecting to Solana">

To connect to the Solana blockchain, like any other Web3 application, you'll need to create a master variable with an RPC endpoint.

We've defined this in a variable called `connection`, and passed in both a Chainstack HTTPS Solana endpoint and a Chainstack WSS Solana endpoint. To retrieve these, do the following:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Navigate to the Chainstack console
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Deploy a Solana mainnet node
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Open the newly deployed node
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Copy the corresponding HTTPS & WSS endpoints
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Paste them into your `Connection` constructor
  </Step>
</Steps>
```js index.js
const connection = new solanaWeb3.Connection("CHAINSTACK_HTTPS_ENDPOINT", {wsEndpoint:"CHAINSTACK_WSS_ENDPOINT"});
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Importing a wallet">

We'll now need a funded Solana wallet. You can either import an existing one, as we do here, or create a fresh one with `solanaWeb3.Keypair.generate()`.

For importing an existing wallet, you'll need to leverage the `fromSecretKey` function on `Keypair`. Within this function, you'll need to pass in your private key converted to a `Uint8Array`, which can be achieved through using `bs58.decode` in a new `Uint8Array`.

```js index.js
const walletKeyPair = solanaWeb3.Keypair.fromSecretKey(new Uint8Array(bs58.decode(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY)));
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Preparing the mint">

To build the mint in preparation for pushing it to Solana, we'll need to use `splToken.createMint`. Within this snippet, it's been saved to a variable called `mint`.

Within `createMint`, we've passed the following parameters:

1. `connection`, our previously defined connection to Solana that leverages Chainstack.
2. `walletKeyPair`, the previously defined object containing both your public and private key.
3. `walletKeyPair.publicKey`, specifically pulling the public key from the `walletKeyPair` object.
4. `null`, this is the `freezeAuthority` parameter, which can either be `null` or a public key.
5. `9`, the decimal place location for the token being minted.
6. `undefined`, filling in an optional `keypair` parameter.
7. `{}`, filling in an optional transaction confirmation instruction parameter.
8. `splToken.TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID` for filling in the `programId` parameter.

```js index.js
  const mint = await splToken.createMint(
    connection,
    walletKeyPair,
    walletKeyPair.publicKey,
    null,
    9,
    undefined,
    {},
    splToken.TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
  );
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Creating the token account">

We'll now need to create a corresponding token account for our SPL token. This can be done through the `getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount` function.

Within this function, we've used the following parameters:

1. `connection`, our previously defined connection to Solana that leverages Chainstack.
2. `walletKeyPair`, the previously defined object containing both your public and private key.
3. `mint`, the previously defined mint object derived from the `createMint` function.
4. `walletKeyPair.publicKey`, specifically pulling the public key from the `walletKeyPair` object.

```js index.js
  const tokenAccount = await splToken.getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount(
    connection,
    walletKeyPair,
    mint,
    walletKeyPair.publicKey,
  );
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Minting the tokens">

For the last step, we'll need to take the `mint` object, and the `tokenAccount` object and actually mint the SPL tokens.

In this snippet, we're calling the `mintTo` function alone without variable assignment. Within this function, we're using the following variables:

1. `connection`, our previously defined connection to Solana that leverages Chainstack.
2. `walletKeyPair`, the previously defined object containing both your public and private key, this is our payer.
3. `mint`, the previously defined mint object derived from the `createMint` function.
4. `tokenAccount.address`, this is the address of the associated token account we made; this is being used as the destination address.
5. `walletKeyPair.publicKey` is the public key of our wallet, specifically being used here as the minting authority.
6. `1000000000000`, the number of tokens being minted. In this case, this'll result in 1000 tokens being minted, due to the previous decimal configuration of `9`.

```js index.js
  await splToken.mintTo(
    connection,
    walletKeyPair,
    mint,
    tokenAccount.address,
    walletKeyPair.publicKey,
    1000000000000,
  )
```

const splToken = require('@solana/spl-token');
const bs58 = require("bs58");

async function main() {

  const connection = new solanaWeb3.Connection("CHAINSTACK_HTTPS_ENDPOINT", {wsEndpoint:"CHAINSTACK_WSS_ENDPOINT"});

  const walletKeyPair = solanaWeb3.Keypair.fromSecretKey(new Uint8Array(bs58.decode(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY)));

  const mint = await splToken.createMint(
    connection,
    walletKeyPair,
    walletKeyPair.publicKey,
    null,
    9,
    undefined,

  const tokenAccount = await splToken.getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount(
    connection,
    walletKeyPair,
    mint,
    walletKeyPair.publicKey,
  );

  await splToken.mintTo(
    connection,
    walletKeyPair,
    mint,
    tokenAccount.address,
    walletKeyPair.publicKey,
    1000000000000,
  )
