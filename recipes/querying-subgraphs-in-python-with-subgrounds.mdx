<Accordion title="Overview">

There are a multitude of ways to interact with subgraphs using Python. In this code snippet, we'll review one of the more streamlined options: using the Subgrounds library to query data and save it in a pandas `DataFrame`.

Subgrounds is a Python library by the Playgrounds team designed specifically to reduce friction present within python-based subgraph querying.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Environment setup">

If you haven't already, ensure that you've installed any version of Python greater than or equal to `3.10`, but less than `4.0`

In this case, the only dependency here is `subgrounds`, which you can install by running: `pip install subgrounds`

```python Python
from subgrounds import Subgrounds
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Defining the subgraph object">

To define the subgraph object, we'll need to first define `sg` and `CHAINSTACK_SUBGRAPH`.

- `sg` can be set equal to `Subgrounds()`
- `CHAINSTACK_SUBGRAPH` can be set equal to the query URL of a chosen subgraph you've [deployed on Chainstack](https://docs.chainstack.com/docs/dedicated-subgraphs#query-a-subgraph).

With these two variables defined, you can call the `load_subgraph` function on `sg` and pass in `CHAINSTACK_SUBGRAPH`.

```python Python
sg = Subgrounds()

CHAINSTACK_SUBGRAPH = "CHAINSTACK_SUBGRAPH_QUERY_URL"

subgraph = sg.load_subgraph(CHAINSTACK_SUBGRAPH)
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Defining the query">

To begin building the query itself, we'll need to define the following:

1. `latest_pairs`, or a variable name of your choice, which will contain the query, `subgraph.Query.{root field}`, in this case, we'll be using the `pairs` root field.
2. Additionally, you'll need to define any query arguments. In this example, we're ordering the results by timestamp in descending order and only returning the first 5 results. For this snippet, this is defined by `orderBy`, `orderDirection`, and `first`.

```python Python
latest_pairs = subgraph.Query.pairs(
  orderBy=subgraph.Pair.createdAtTimestamp,
  orderDirection='desc',
  first=5,
)
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Executing the query">

Now we'll need to execute the query and save it in a variable called `result`. Subgrounds gives you a variety of options regarding the format of the result, this can be changed by using a corresponding query function:

1. `query_df` returns data in a pandas `DataFrame`, which is what we're using in this snippet
2. `query_json` returns data in a JSON format, specifically of type `dict`.
3. `query` returns data based on its shape, and can return types `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, `tuple`, or `None`.

Within the query function, you'll need to include the specific values that you'd like to be included in the response.

```python Python
result = sg.query_df([
  latest_pairs.id,
  latest_pairs.token0.symbol,
  latest_pairs.token0.name,
  latest_pairs.token0.decimals,
  latest_pairs.token1.symbol,
  latest_pairs.token1.name,
  latest_pairs.token1.decimals,
  latest_pairs.reserve0,
  latest_pairs.reserve1,
  latest_pairs.token0Price,
  latest_pairs.token1Price,
  latest_pairs.createdAtTimestamp,
  latest_pairs.createdAtBlockNumber,
  latest_pairs.syncAtTimestamp,
])
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Understanding the response">
The response you get will vary significantly depending on the query parameters, specific return values, and the format in which you request the data.

In this case, due to the snippet using a pandas `DataFrame`, we can see a truncated view of the table containing the data we queried.

```python Python
from subgrounds import Subgrounds

sg = Subgrounds()

CHAINSTACK_SUBGRAPH = "CHAINSTACK_SUBGRAPH_QUERY_URL"

subgraph = sg.load_subgraph(CHAINSTACK_SUBGRAPH)

latest_pairs = subgraph.Query.pairs(
  orderBy=subgraph.Pair.createdAtTimestamp,
  orderDirection='desc',
  first=5,
