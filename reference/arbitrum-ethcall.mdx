title: eth_call | Arbitrum
openapi: /openapi/arbitrum_node_api/execute_transactions/eth_call.json POST /5b8d22690a57f293b3a1ed8758014e35
---

Arbitrum API method that enables instant execution of a new message call without requiring the creation of a transaction on the blockchain. This can be useful for testing and debugging by simulating transfers or smart contract transactions and retrieving data from the blockchain.

<Note>
**Disclaimer**

The interactive example in this page uses `eth_call` to call the `owner` method from the [Uniswap V3: Factory smart contract on Arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984#code). It returns the address owning the smart contract.

## Parameters

* `object` — the transaction call object:

  + `from` — (optional) the string of the address used to send the transaction.
  + `to` — the string of the address to which the transaction is directed, a wallet, or a smart contract.
  + `gas` — (optional) the maximum amount of gas that can be used by the transaction.
  + `gasprice` — (optional) the amount of gas price the sender is willing to pay for each gas unit in [Wei](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ether/#denominations).
  + `value` — (optional) the value sent with this transaction, encoded as hexadecimal.
  + `data` — (optional) additional data to be sent with the call, usually used to invoke functions from smart contracts as a string of the hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. See the [Ethereum Contract ABI](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/abi-spec.html).
* `quantity or tag` — the integer of a block encoded as hexadecimal or the string with:

  + `latest` — the most recent block in the blockchain and the current state of the blockchain at the most recent block
  + `earliest` — the earliest available or genesis block
  + `pending` — the pending state and transactions block. The current state of transactions that have been broadcast to the network but have not yet been included in a block.

<Note>
See the [default block parameter](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#the-default-block-parameter).
</Note>


## Response

* `data` — the result of executing the specified call on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), encoded as a hexadecimal string.

## `eth_call` code examples

The following code snippets provide a clear demonstration of how to simulate a standard ETH transfer between two accounts. Note that when using `eth_call` to simulate a transfer or a smart contract transaction, the sender account must have a sufficient balance to cover the associated gas fee.

```javascript web3.js
const Web3 = require("web3");
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

async function simulateTransfer() {
    try {
        // Define the accounts to transfer between
        const fromAddress = "0x28165971E4d592CA6C45A3786786Ec2f6b4b8D23";
        const toAddress = "0x19e7e376e7c213b7e7e7e46cc70a5dd086daff2a";

        // Define the value to transfer (converted to Wei)
        const value = web3.utils.toWei("100", "ether");

        // Build transaction object
        const transactionObject = {
            from: fromAddress,
            to: toAddress,
            gas: 21000, // 21000 is the standard for a regular tranfer
            value: value,
            data: ""
        }

        // Use eth_call to simulate the transfer on the latest block
        const result = await web3.eth.call({
            transactionObject
        }, "latest");

        console.log(`Transaction hash: ${result}`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
    }
}

simulateTransfer();
```

```javascript ethers.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);

const simulateTransfer = async () => {
  try {    
    // Define the accounts to transfer between
    const fromAddress = "0x28165971E4d592CA6C45A3786786Ec2f6b4b8D23";
    const toAddress = "0x19e7e376e7c213b7e7e7e46cc70a5dd086daff2a";

    // Define the value to transfer
    const value = ethers.utils.parseEther("100");

    // Build transaction object
    const transactionObject = {
        from: fromAddress,
        to: toAddress,
        gasLimit: ethers.utils.hexlify(21000),
        value: value
    }

    // Use eth_call to simulate the transfer on the latest block
    const result = await provider.call(transactionObject);
    console.log(`Result: ${result}`);

  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);

  }
}

simulateTransfer();
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3  
node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL"

web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url)) 

# Define the accounts to transfer between
from_address = web3.to_checksum_address('0x28165971E4d592CA6C45A3786786Ec2f6b4b8D23')
to_address = web3.to_checksum_address('0x19e7e376e7c213b7e7e7e46cc70a5dd086daff2a')

# Define the value to transfer (in Ether)
value = web3.to_wei(1, 'ether')

# Build the transaction object
transaction = {
    'from': from_address,
    'to': to_address,
    'gas': 21000,  # 21000 is the standard for a regular transfer
    'value': value,
    'data': '',
}

# Use eth_call to simulate the transfer
result = web3.eth.call(transaction, 'latest')
print(result)
```
</CodeGroup>


Executing this code will produce a return value of `0x`, indicating a successful transaction. This implies that the transaction will be executed without any errors when the code is used to send the transaction.

## Use case

A common use case for `eth_call` is calling smart contract functions. For example, interact with an ERC-20 token smart contract deployed on the Arbitrum network and retrieve the balance of a specific account.

The following code uses the web3.js library to call the `balanceOf` function of the [UNI token smart contract](https://arbiscan.io/token/0xfa7f8980b0f1e64a2062791cc3b0871572f1f7f0#readProxyContract) on the Arbitrum network.

```javascript index.js
const Web3 = require("web3");
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

// Contract address and ABI for the token
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0xFa7F8980b0f1E64A2062791cc3b0871572f1F7f0";
const ABI = [
  {
    "constant": true,
    "inputs": [
      {
        "name": "_owner",
        "type": "address"
      }
    ],
    "name": "balanceOf",
    "outputs": [
      {
        "name": "balance",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ],
    "payable": false,
    "stateMutability": "view",
    "type": "function"
  }
];

// Asynchronously fetches the balance of an account for the given address
async function getAccountBalance(address) {
  try {
    // Create a new contract instance
    const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(ABI, CONTRACT_ADDRESS);

    // Call the balanceOf function to retrieve the account balance in wei using eth_call
    const balanceInWei = await contract.methods.balanceOf(address).call();

    // Convert the balance from wei to ethers
    const balanceInEth = web3.utils.fromWei(balanceInWei, "ether");

    // Log the account balance in ethers to the console
    console.log(`The account balance for address ${address} is: ${balanceInEth} UNI`);
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error occurred while fetching account balance:", error);
  }
}

// Call the getAccountBalance function with a sample account address
getAccountBalance("0x1b72bac3772050fdcaf468cce7e20deb3cb02d89");
```


The `getAccountBalance` function is called with the address of the account whose balance we want to retrieve. This function creates a new contract instance calls the `balanceOf` function of the smart contract with the provided address and retrieves the account balance in Wei. The balance is then converted to the ethers unit using the `fromWei` function of the `web3.utils` object.

Finally, the account balance is printed on the console for easy viewing.
