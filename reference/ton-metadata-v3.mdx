The `metadata` endpoint queries address metadata from the TON blockchain indexer. This includes human-readable names, scam flags, icons, and other identifying information for known addresses.

## Parameters

* `address` (string, required) — The address to get metadata for.

## Response

* `address` (string) — The queried address.
* `name` (string) — Human-readable name for the address (if known).
* `is_scam` (boolean) — Whether the address is flagged as a scam.
* `icon` (string) — URL to the address icon (if available).
* `is_wallet` (boolean) — Whether the address is a wallet contract.

## Use case

The `metadata` endpoint is valuable for improving user experience and security:

1. Wallet applications displaying friendly names instead of raw addresses.
2. Scam detection by checking addresses before sending funds.
3. Block explorers showing rich information about addresses.
4. DApps displaying icons for known contracts and tokens.
5. Security tools identifying potentially malicious addresses.

Here's an example of getting address metadata:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  curl -X GET \
    'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v3/metadata?address=EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs' \
    -H 'accept: application/json'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Always check the `is_scam` flag before interacting with unknown addresses. This can help protect users from known malicious actors on the network.
</Warning>
