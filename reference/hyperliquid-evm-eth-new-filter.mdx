<Info>
This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available on Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support them yet — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `eth_newFilter` JSON-RPC method creates a filter object to notify when logs match the specified criteria. This method returns a filter ID that can be used with `eth_getFilterChanges` and `eth_getFilterLogs` to retrieve matching logs. Filters are essential for monitoring specific events on the blockchain.

## Parameters

1. **filter_object** (object) — The filter criteria object with the following properties:
   - `fromBlock` (string, optional) — Block number (hexadecimal) or tag ("latest", "earliest", "pending")
   - `toBlock` (string, optional) — Block number (hexadecimal) or tag ("latest", "earliest", "pending")
   - `address` (string or array, optional) — Contract address or array of addresses to filter
   - `topics` (array, optional) — Array of topic hashes to match (supports null wildcards)

## Response

The method returns a filter ID as a hexadecimal string that can be used to retrieve filter results.

### Response structure

**Filter ID:**
- Returns a unique filter identifier as a hexadecimal string
- Use this ID with `eth_getFilterChanges` to get new matching logs
- Use this ID with `eth_getFilterLogs` to get all matching logs
- Filters have a limited lifetime and may expire

### Filter object options

**Block range:**
- `fromBlock` and `toBlock` define the block range to monitor
- Use "latest" to monitor from the current block
- Use specific block numbers in hexadecimal format

**Address filtering:**
- Single address: `"0xB7C609cFfa0e47DB2467ea03fF3e598bf59361A5"`
- Multiple addresses: `["0xAddr1", "0xAddr2"]`
- Omit to match logs from any address

**Topic filtering:**
- Topics are indexed event parameters
- Array position corresponds to topic index (topic0, topic1, etc.)
- Use `null` as wildcard for any value at that position
- Empty array `[]` matches all topics

## Usage example

### Basic implementation

```javascript
// Create a new filter
const createFilter = async (filterOptions) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/YOUR_ENDPOINT/evm', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      method: 'eth_newFilter',
      params: [filterOptions],
      id: 1
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.result;
};

// Monitor specific contract events
const monitorContractEvents = async (contractAddress, eventSignature) => {
  const filter = await createFilter({
    fromBlock: 'latest',
    toBlock: 'latest',
    address: contractAddress,
    topics: [eventSignature] // topic0 is the event signature hash
  });
  
  console.log(`Created filter ${filter} for contract ${contractAddress}`);
  return filter;
};

// Create filter for ERC-20 Transfer events
const monitorTokenTransfers = async (tokenAddress, fromAddress = null, toAddress = null) => {
  // Transfer event signature: Transfer(address,address,uint256)
  const transferSignature = '0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef';
  
  const topics = [transferSignature];
  
  // Add indexed parameters (from and to addresses)
  if (fromAddress) {
    topics.push('0x000000000000000000000000' + fromAddress.slice(2).toLowerCase());
  } else {
    topics.push(null); // Wildcard for any from address
  }
  
  if (toAddress) {
    topics.push('0x000000000000000000000000' + toAddress.slice(2).toLowerCase());
  }
  
  const filter = await createFilter({
    fromBlock: 'latest',
    toBlock: 'latest',
    address: tokenAddress,
    topics: topics
  });
  
  return filter;
};

// Monitor multiple contracts
const monitorMultipleContracts = async (addresses, topics = []) => {
  const filter = await createFilter({
    fromBlock: 'latest',
    toBlock: 'latest',
    address: addresses,
    topics: topics
  });
  
  console.log(`Created multi-contract filter: ${filter}`);
  return filter;
};

// Historical event filter
const createHistoricalFilter = async (fromBlock, toBlock, contractAddress) => {
  const filter = await createFilter({
    fromBlock: `0x${fromBlock.toString(16)}`,
    toBlock: `0x${toBlock.toString(16)}`,
    address: contractAddress,
    topics: []
  });
  
  console.log(`Created historical filter from block ${fromBlock} to ${toBlock}`);
  return filter;
};

// Usage examples
const contractAddress = '0xB7C609cFfa0e47DB2467ea03fF3e598bf59361A5';

// Monitor all events from a contract
monitorContractEvents(contractAddress, null).then(filterId => {
  console.log('Monitor filter created:', filterId);
});

// Monitor token transfers
monitorTokenTransfers(contractAddress).then(filterId => {
  console.log('Transfer filter created:', filterId);
});

// Monitor multiple contracts
const addresses = [
  '0xB7C609cFfa0e47DB2467ea03fF3e598bf59361A5',
  '0xAnother...Address'
];
monitorMultipleContracts(addresses).then(filterId => {
  console.log('Multi-contract filter created:', filterId);
});
```
