---

The `eth_getBlockByNumber` JSON-RPC method returns information about a block by its number. This method is essential for retrieving block data when you know the block number, commonly used for sequential block processing, blockchain synchronization, and historical data analysis.

## Parameters

The method takes two parameters:

1. **Block number** - The number of the block to retrieve
2. **Full transaction objects** - Whether to return full transaction objects or just hashes

### Parameter details

* `blockNumber` (string, required) — Block identifier: `"latest"`, `"earliest"`, `"pending"`, or a specific block number in hexadecimal
* `fullTransactionObjects` (boolean, required) — If `true`, returns full transaction objects; if `false`, returns only transaction hashes

## Response

The method returns detailed information about the specified block, or `null` if the block is not found.

### Response structure

**Block object:**
- `number` — Block number as a hexadecimal string
- `hash` — The 32-byte hash of the block
- `parentHash` — Hash of the parent block
- `timestamp` — Block timestamp as a Unix timestamp in hexadecimal
- `gasLimit` — Maximum gas allowed in this block
- `gasUsed` — Total gas used by all transactions in the block
- `transactions` — Array of transaction hashes or full transaction objects
- `miner` — Address of the block miner/validator
- `difficulty` — Block difficulty (may be 0 for some consensus mechanisms)
- `totalDifficulty` — Total difficulty of the chain until this block
- `size` — Block size in bytes as a hexadecimal string
- `extraData` — Extra data field of the block
- `nonce` — Block nonce (if applicable)
- `receiptsRoot` — Root hash of the receipts trie
- `stateRoot` — Root hash of the state trie
- `transactionsRoot` — Root hash of the transactions trie

### Block number formats

**Special identifiers:**
- `"latest"` — Most recent block
- `"earliest"` — Genesis block (block 0)
- `"pending"` — Pending block being mined

**Hexadecimal numbers:**
- `"0x0"` — Genesis block
- `"0x1"` — Block 1
- `"0x9d0c37"` — Block 10,291,255 (decimal)

## Hyperliquid-specific considerations

### System transactions

**HyperCore transactions:**
- Blocks may contain system transactions that originate from HyperCore
- Use `eth_getSystemTxsByBlockNumber` to retrieve system transactions specifically
- System transactions are separate from regular user transactions
- Important for complete block analysis and understanding network activity

### Block processing

**Sequential access:**
- Process blocks sequentially for complete chain analysis
- Handle missing blocks gracefully in case of gaps
- Use block numbers for efficient sequential processing
- Track last processed block for incremental updates

**Block number formats:**
- `"latest"` — Most recent block
- `"earliest"` — Genesis block (block 0)
- `"0x1a4"` — Specific block number in hexadecimal (420 in decimal)

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["0x9d0c37",false],"id":1}' \

```

## Use cases

The `eth_getBlockByNumber` method is essential for applications that need to:

* **Blockchain synchronization**: Download and process blocks sequentially
* **Block explorers**: Display block information and enable navigation
* **Analytics platforms**: Collect block data for network analysis
* **Transaction monitoring**: Track transactions within specific blocks
* **Historical analysis**: Study past blockchain states and events
* **Audit systems**: Verify blockchain integrity and transaction history
* **Development tools**: Debug and test blockchain applications
* **System transaction analysis**: Analyze both regular and HyperCore system transactions
* **Network monitoring**: Track block production and network health
* **Integration services**: Provide block data to external systems

<Note>
Block numbers are sequential. If a block number doesn't exist (e.g., future block), the method returns `null`. On Hyperliquid, blocks may contain system transactions from HyperCore - use `eth_getSystemTxsByBlockNumber` to retrieve these separately.
