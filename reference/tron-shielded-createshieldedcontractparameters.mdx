<Warning>
This endpoint requires valid cryptographic material generated from your shielded keys and transaction data. All hex string parameters must be properly formatted (0x-prefixed) and derived from legitimate shielded transaction construction. Invalid or placeholder values will result in parsing errors.
</Warning>

## Parameters

* `spend_authority_signature` — the spending authority signature for the transaction
* `view_signature` — the view signature component  
* `proof_generation_key` — the proof generation key for creating zero-knowledge proofs
* `payment_address` — the recipient's shielded payment address
* `rcm` — the randomness commitment value
* `ar` — the authentication randomness value
* `alpha` — the alpha parameter for proof generation
* `rsk` — the randomness for spending key
* `ask` — the authentication secret key

## Response

* `receive_description` — the receive description for the shielded transaction
* `spend_description` — the spend description for the shielded transaction
* `binding_signature` — the binding signature that ties the transaction together

## Use case

The `wallet/createshieldedcontractparameters` method is used for:

* Creating the cryptographic parameters needed for shielded TRC20 transfers
* Generating zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving transactions
* Preparing transaction data that maintains sender and recipient anonymity
* Supporting advanced shielded contract functionality in wallets and applications
