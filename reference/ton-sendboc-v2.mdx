The `sendBoc` method sends a serialized bag-of-cells (BoC) to the TON blockchain. This is the primary method for submitting signed transactions to the network.

<Info>
  There's no difference between a full node an archive node in data availability or pricing. All data is always available and all node requests are consumed as 1 request unit.

## Request body

* `boc` (string, required) — The serialized bag-of-cells in base64 format. This contains the signed external message to be sent to the blockchain.

## JSON-RPC

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  curl -X POST \
    'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v2/jsonRPC' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": 1,
      "method": "sendBoc",

## Response

* `ok` (boolean) — Whether the operation was successful.

* `result` (object) — The result of the operation. Contains:

  * `@type` (string) — The type of the result, typically `ok` for successful submissions.
  * `@extra` (string) — Extra information about the operation.

## Use case

The `sendBoc` method is essential for any application that needs to send transactions to the TON blockchain:

1. Wallet applications use this to broadcast user-signed transactions.
2. Smart contract deployment tools send compiled contracts to the network.
3. DApps submit user interactions with smart contracts.
4. Automated trading bots execute trades on DEXs.
5. Token transfer services broadcast transfer transactions.

Here's an example of sending a simple TON transfer:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v2/sendBoc' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "boc": "te6ccgEBAgEAqwAB4YgBVbC7Hu+g3htYXzst8L5ucV76NMzeBK3URJKebN2Y1kwADRfFu/r0HxgrOp/Iml8Li5x4gR10J5XYFS8z0fMWJ6JPeUF5xNSLrSDGFIqhJqkW1SEYQF8Dw5p4dI3oaFs4LCmpoxdkfKw0AAAAGAAcAQBoQgAwwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL68="
  }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  To create a valid BoC for sending, you typically need to:
  1. Create the message payload
  2. Sign it with your private key
  3. Serialize it to base64 format

  Libraries like TonWeb, ton-core, or the TON SDK handle this process.
