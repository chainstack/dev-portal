## Parameters

1. **transaction hash** (string, required): The hash of the failed transaction to analyze

## Response

The method returns the raw error data from the failed transaction, or null if the transaction succeeded or error data is unavailable.

### Response structure

- `result` — hex-encoded error message from the revert reason, or `null` if not available

## Usage example

```shell Shell
curl -X POST https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/4f8d8f4040bdacd1577bff8058438274/evm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "ots_getTransactionError",
    "params": ["0xf94f3d2ed5b59aefb6a0e566af8e86552014d84f6ed2f38a1366dedffe723381"],
    "id": 1
  }'
```

### Example response (with error)

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": "0x08c379a00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001e496e73756666696369656e742062616c616e636520666f72207472616e736665720000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```

### Example response (no error)

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": null
}
```

### Decoding error messages

The returned hex data typically contains an ABI-encoded error message. Common patterns:
- `0x08c379a0...` — Standard revert with string message
- Custom error selectors — Contract-specific error codes

To decode the message, remove the function selector (first 4 bytes) and ABI-decode the remaining data as a string.

## Use cases

The `ots_getTransactionError` method is essential for:

* **Smart contract debugging**: Understand why transactions failed
* **User experience**: Display meaningful error messages to users
* **Testing automation**: Validate expected failure conditions
* **Error monitoring**: Track and categorize contract failures
* **Support tools**: Help users understand transaction failures
* **Development workflow**: Debug contract interactions during development
* **Audit trails**: Document failure reasons for compliance
* **Gas optimization**: Identify operations that consistently fail
* **Integration testing**: Verify error handling in dApps
* **Customer support**: Quickly diagnose user transaction issues

This method is particularly valuable during smart contract development and when providing support for dApp users experiencing transaction failures.
