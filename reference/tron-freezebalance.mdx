TRON API method that stakes TRX for bandwidth or energy resources (deprecated method). This method freezes TRX tokens to obtain bandwidth or energy resources, which are required for transaction execution. Note that this is the legacy staking mechanism, replaced by `freezebalancev2`.

## Parameters

* `owner_address` — the address that owns the TRX to freeze (hex format)
* `frozen_balance` — the amount of TRX to freeze (in sun, where 1 TRX = 1,000,000 sun)
* `frozen_duration` — the duration to freeze for (minimum 3 days)
* `resource` — the resource type to obtain ("BANDWIDTH" or "ENERGY")
* `receiver_address` — optional address to receive the resources (defaults to owner_address)
* `visible` — optional boolean to specify address format (default: false for hex format)

## Response

* `visible` — boolean indicating address format used
* `txID` — transaction ID hash
* `raw_data` — raw transaction data object
* `raw_data_hex` — hexadecimal representation of raw transaction data

## Use case

The `wallet/freezebalance` method is used for:

* Staking TRX to obtain bandwidth for free transactions (legacy method).
* Freezing TRX to get energy for smart contract execution (legacy method).
* Supporting older applications that still use the original staking mechanism.
* Migrating from the deprecated staking system to the new `freezebalancev2` method.
