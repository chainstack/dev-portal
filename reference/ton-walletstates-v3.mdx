## Parameters

* `address` (string, required) — The wallet address to query.
* `limit` (integer, optional) — Maximum number of results. Default: `10`.
* `offset` (integer, optional) — Number of results to skip. Default: `0`.

## Response

* `wallets` (array) — Array of wallet state objects:
  * `address` (string) — Wallet address.
  * `is_wallet` (boolean) — Whether the address is a recognized wallet contract.
  * `balance` (string) — Balance in nanotons.
  * `status` (string) — Account status (active, uninit, frozen).
  * `code_hash` (string) — Hash of the code cell.
  * `last_transaction_hash` (string) — Hash of last transaction.
  * `last_transaction_lt` (string) — Logical time of last transaction.

* `address_book` (object) — Address book mapping with names for known addresses.

## Use case

The `walletStates` endpoint is useful for applications working with wallet contracts:

1. Wallet applications displaying account status and balance.
2. Portfolio trackers monitoring multiple addresses.
3. Payment systems verifying wallet state before transactions.
4. Block explorers identifying wallet types.
5. Analytics tools categorizing addresses as wallets vs contracts.

Here's an example of getting wallet state:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  curl -X GET \
    'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v3/walletStates?address=EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs' \
    -H 'accept: application/json'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  The `is_wallet` field indicates whether the contract matches a known wallet implementation (v3, v4, etc.). Jetton masters and other contracts will show `false`.
