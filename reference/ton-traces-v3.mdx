# Traces

The `traces` endpoint retrieves transaction traces from the TON blockchain. A trace represents the complete execution path of a transaction, including all resulting internal messages and their effects across the network.

<Note>
**TON pricing is the same for full, archive, v2, v3**

There's no difference between a full node an archive node in data availability or pricing.
All data is always available and all node requests are consumed as 1 request unit.

## Parameters

* `trace_id` (string, optional) — Filter by specific trace ID.
* `tx_hash` (string, optional) — Get traces for a specific transaction hash.
* `tx_lt` (integer, optional) — Filter by transaction logical time.
* `limit` (integer, optional) — Maximum number of traces to return. Default: `10`.
* `offset` (integer, optional) — Number of traces to skip for pagination. Default: `0`.
* `sort` (string, optional) — Sort order: `asc` or `desc`. Default: `desc`.

## Response

* `traces` (array) — Array of trace objects containing:
  * `trace_id` (string) — Unique identifier for the trace.
  * `external_hash` (string) — Hash of the external message that initiated the trace.
  * `mc_seqno_start` (integer) — Masterchain sequence number when the trace started.
  * `mc_seqno_end` (integer) — Masterchain sequence number when the trace ended.
  * `start_lt` (integer) — Logical time when the trace started.
  * `start_utime` (integer) — Unix timestamp when the trace started.
  * `end_lt` (integer) — Logical time when the trace ended.
  * `end_utime` (integer) — Unix timestamp when the trace ended.
  * `state` (string) — Current state of the trace (e.g., `complete`, `pending`).
  * `pending_edges` (integer) — Number of pending message edges.
  * `edges` (integer) — Total number of message edges in the trace.
  * `nodes` (integer) — Total number of transaction nodes in the trace.
  * `classification_state` (string) — Classification state of the trace.

* `address_book` (object) — Address book mapping raw addresses to user-friendly information.

## Use case

The `traces` endpoint is essential for understanding the complete execution flow of transactions:

1. Debugging failed transactions by tracing the exact execution path.
2. Analyzing multi-hop transactions across multiple smart contracts.
3. Understanding fee distribution across a transaction's execution.
4. Building transaction explorers that show complete message flows.
5. Auditing smart contract interactions and their side effects.

Here's an example of getting a trace for a specific transaction:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  curl -X GET \
    'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v3/traces?tx_hash=BhLJTdV2R6Vr5c3BAOjH8nFpnMYOuPcJvRlagGSKU88%3D&limit=1' \
    -H 'accept: application/json'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Traces are particularly useful for understanding Jetton and NFT transfers, which typically involve multiple internal messages between minter, wallet, and recipient contracts.
