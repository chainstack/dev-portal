<Info>
This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available on Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support them yet — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `info` endpoint with `type: "delegatorSummary"` provides a concise overview of a user's delegation status on the Hyperliquid network. This endpoint returns key metrics about the user's staking position, including total delegated amounts, undelegated amounts, and pending withdrawal information.

## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"delegatorSummary"` to retrieve user's delegation summary.
* `user` (string, required) — Address in 42-character hexadecimal format (e.g., `0x2ba553d9f990a3b66b03b2dc0d030dfc1c061036`).

## Response

The response is an object containing a summary of the user's delegation status:

### Delegation metrics

* `delegated` (string) — Total amount currently delegated by the user across all validators
* `undelegated` (string) — Total amount that has been undelegated but may still be in unbonding period
* `totalPendingWithdrawal` (string) — Total amount pending withdrawal (currently in unbonding period)
* `nPendingWithdrawals` (integer) — Number of pending withdrawal transactions

### Understanding the metrics

**Delegated amount:**
- Represents the total tokens actively staked with validators
- These tokens are earning rewards but are locked for network security
- Can be undelegated at any time, subject to unbonding period

**Undelegated amount:**
- Shows tokens that have been removed from active delegation
- May include tokens that have completed the unbonding process
- Represents tokens no longer earning staking rewards

**Pending withdrawals:**
- Tokens currently in the unbonding period after undelegation
- Cannot be transferred or re-delegated until unbonding completes
- The number of pending withdrawals indicates separate undelegation transactions

**Use cases for summary data:**
- Quick portfolio overview for staking dashboards
- Balance checks before making new delegations
- Monitoring unbonding progress
- Calculating available vs locked token amounts
- Portfolio allocation analysis

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "delegatorSummary", "user": "0x2ba553d9f990a3b66b03b2dc0d030dfc1c061036"}' \
  https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/4f8d8f4040bdacd1577bff8058438274/info
```

## Example response

```json
{
    "delegated": "100233.20588006",
    "undelegated": "0.0",
    "totalPendingWithdrawal": "0.0",
    "nPendingWithdrawals": 0
}
```

## Use case

The `info` endpoint with `type: "delegatorSummary"` is essential for applications that need to:

* **Portfolio dashboards**: Display high-level staking metrics and account status
* **Balance verification**: Check available delegation capacity before new stakes
* **Withdrawal tracking**: Monitor pending undelegations and unbonding progress
* **Quick status checks**: Provide instant overview of user's staking position
* **Mobile applications**: Show essential staking data with minimal API calls
* **Notification systems**: Alert users about completed unbonding periods
* **Risk assessment**: Evaluate liquidity constraints from locked tokens
* **Automated rebalancing**: Determine available tokens for delegation adjustments
* **Tax reporting**: Calculate total staked amounts for compliance purposes
* **User onboarding**: Show new users their current staking status
* **Performance monitoring**: Track changes in delegation amounts over time
* **Liquidity planning**: Understand token availability for trading or transfers

This endpoint is particularly valuable for applications requiring efficient data retrieval with minimal overhead, mobile apps with bandwidth constraints, and systems that need quick validation of user staking status before executing delegation-related operations on the Hyperliquid network.
