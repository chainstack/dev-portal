The Solana `getBlock` method returns complete information about a block for a given **slot height**.

<Note>
**Block & slot confusion**

You need to provide the slot number in the [getBlock](/reference/solana-getblocks) method. For a detailed explanation with examples, see [Understanding the difference between blocks and slots on Solana](/docs/understanding-the-difference-between-blocks-and-slots-on-solana).
</Note>


This method provides detailed information about the block, including its parent block, transactions, and the state of the ledger after processing the block. It is useful for retrieving the state of the blockchain at a specific block height.

## Parameters

* `block` — the height of **the slot** to retrieve information for.
* `commitment` — `confirmed` or `finalized`. `processed` is not supported.
* `transactionDetails` — level of transaction details.
* `maxSupportedTransactionVersion` — for transaction versioning
* `rewards` — block rewards that go to validators.

## Response

* `blockHeight` — the actual block number produced in the slot.
* `blockTime` — Unix timestamp of the block. Also note that this is the timestamp agreed upon by the cluster validators. Most of the time, it doesn't matter that much but still important to know.
* `blockhash` — the hash of the block.
* `parentSlot` — the slot of the block's parent.
* `previousBlockhash` — the hash of the block's parent.
* `rewards` — an array of reward objects that were awarded when the block was processed.
* `transactions` — an array of transaction objects that were processed in the block.

## Use case

A practical use case for `getBlock` is to retrieve detailed information about a specific block. This can be useful for block explorers, wallets, or other applications that need to display or make use of this information.
