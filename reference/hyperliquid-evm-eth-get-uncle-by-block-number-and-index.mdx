---

The `eth_getUncleByBlockNumberAndIndex` JSON-RPC method returns information about an uncle block by block number and uncle index position. Uncle blocks are valid blocks that were not included in the main chain but are referenced by the main chain blocks for network security.

## Parameters

1. **block_number** (string) — The block number as a hexadecimal string, or one of the string tags: "latest", "earliest", or "pending"
2. **uncle_index** (string) — The uncle index position as a hexadecimal string (e.g., "0x0" for the first uncle)

## Response

The method returns uncle block information or `null` if no uncle exists at the specified index.

### Response structure

**Uncle block information:**
- Returns uncle block object with header information if found
- Returns `null` if no uncle exists at the specified index
- Uncle blocks contain header information but no transaction data

### Block number tags

**Available tags:**
- `"latest"` — The most recent block in the chain
- `"earliest"` — The genesis block (block 0)
- `"pending"` — The pending state/transactions

**Hexadecimal format:**
- Block numbers can be specified as hexadecimal strings with "0x" prefix
- Example: "0x1b4" represents block 436 in decimal

## Usage example

### Basic implementation

```javascript
// Get uncle block by number and index
const getUncleByBlockNumberAndIndex = async (blockNumber, uncleIndex) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/YOUR_ENDPOINT/evm', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      method: 'eth_getUncleByBlockNumberAndIndex',
      params: [blockNumber, uncleIndex],
      id: 1
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.result;
};

// Monitor latest block for uncles
const monitorLatestBlockUncles = async () => {
  const uncles = [];
  let index = 0;
  
  while (true) {
    const uncle = await getUncleByBlockNumberAndIndex(
      'latest',
      `0x${index.toString(16)}`
    );
    
    if (uncle === null) {
      break;
    }
    
    uncles.push(uncle);
    index++;
  }
  
  return uncles;
};

// Check uncles in a specific block
const checkBlockUncles = async (blockNumber) => {
  const result = {
    blockNumber,
    uncles: [],
    uncleCount: 0
  };
  
  let index = 0;
  while (true) {
    const uncle = await getUncleByBlockNumberAndIndex(
      blockNumber,
      `0x${index.toString(16)}`
    );
    
    if (uncle === null) {
      break;
    }
    
    result.uncles.push(uncle);
    index++;
  }
  
  result.uncleCount = result.uncles.length;
  return result;
};

// Usage
monitorLatestBlockUncles().then(uncles => {
  console.log(`Latest block has ${uncles.length} uncles`);
});

checkBlockUncles('0x100').then(result => {
  console.log(`Block ${result.blockNumber} has ${result.uncleCount} uncles`);
});
```
