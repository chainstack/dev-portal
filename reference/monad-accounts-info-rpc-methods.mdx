Retrieving account information from the Monad blockchain can be done by using the following methods:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="eth_getBalance" icon="angle-right" iconType="solid" href="/reference/monad-getbalance" horizontal/>
  <Card title="eth_getTransactionCount" icon="angle-right" iconType="solid" href="/reference/monad-gettransactioncount" horizontal/>
  <Card title="eth_getCode" icon="angle-right" iconType="solid" href="/reference/monad-getcode" horizontal/>
  <Card title="eth_getStorageAt" icon="angle-right" iconType="solid" href="/reference/monad-getstorageat" horizontal/>
</CardGroup>

This information can be used for:

* **Balance checking** — query account balances for wallets and smart contracts.
* **Nonce management** — retrieve transaction counts for proper transaction ordering.
* **Contract verification** — check if an address contains smart contract code.
* **DApp development** — integrate account data into decentralized applications for user dashboards and transaction management.
