Base API method `eth_createAccessList` generates an access list for a transaction based on specific default values. An access list includes addresses and storage keys the transaction intends to access, facilitating more efficient gas usage.

## Parameters

* `transactionObject` — an object containing transaction parameters with default values:
  + `from` — the address of the sender.
  + `data` — the data being sent with the transaction.
* `blockParameter` — specifies the blockchain state to use for generating the access list, with a default value of `"pending"`.

## Response

* `result` — an object containing:
  + `accessList` — the generated access list, detailing addresses and storage keys the transaction will access.
  + `gasUsed` — the estimated gas used to execute the transaction with the generated access list.

## Use case

The `eth_createAccessList` method is crucial for:

* Preparing transactions that optimize gas usage by explicitly stating which addresses and storage keys will be accessed.
* Developers aiming to reduce transaction costs and improve efficiency on the Base network.
* Transactions that comply with EIP-2930, which introduces access lists as a transaction type to specify state access.

This method provides a practical approach to optimizing transaction execution and gas usage on the Base blockchain by pre-determining the access list.
