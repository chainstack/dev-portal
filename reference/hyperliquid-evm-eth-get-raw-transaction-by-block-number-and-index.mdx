## Parameters

* `blockNumber` (string, required) — Block number in hex format, or one of the special tags: "earliest", "latest", "pending", or "finalized"
* `transactionIndex` (string, required) — The index position of the transaction in the block (hex string)

## Returns

Returns the raw transaction data as a hex-encoded string, or `null` if the block or transaction is not found.

The raw transaction data is RLP-encoded and includes all transaction fields in their original binary format.

<Note>
Transaction indices start from 0x0. Use hex format for the index parameter. Block number can be a hex string (e.g., "0x64") or special tags like "latest" for the most recent block.

* **Streaming transaction data** — Monitor new transactions as blocks are mined
* **Data pipeline integration** — Feed raw transaction data to processing systems
* **Backup and recovery** — Create transaction backups in original format
* **Performance testing** — Replay transactions for load testing
