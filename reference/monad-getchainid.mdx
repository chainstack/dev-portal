## `eth_chainId` code examples

<CodeGroup>
```javascript ethers.js
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL");

async function getChainId() {
  const network = await provider.getNetwork();
  console.log(`Chain ID: ${network.chainId}`);
}

getChainId();
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3

node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL"

web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url))
chain_id = web3.eth.chain_id
print(f'Chain ID: {chain_id}')
```

## Use case

A practical use case for `eth_chainId` is verifying that your application is connected to the correct network before sending transactions, which is essential for preventing accidental transactions on the wrong network.
