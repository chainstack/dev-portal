## Parameters

* `owner_address` — address of the account that will become a witness. Use base58 with `visible: true`, or hex with `visible: false`.
* `url` — witness website URL providing information about the witness (must be a valid URL)
* `visible` — optional boolean. When `true`, addresses are base58; when `false`, hex. Default is `true`.

## Response

* `visible` — boolean indicating whether addresses are in visible format
* `txID` — unique transaction ID for the witness creation transaction
* `raw_data` — raw transaction data containing:
  * `contract` — array with witness creation contract details
  * `ref_block_bytes` — reference block bytes for transaction validation
  * `ref_block_hash` — hash of the reference block
  * `expiration` — transaction expiration timestamp
  * `timestamp` — transaction creation timestamp
* `raw_data_hex` — complete transaction data encoded in hexadecimal format

## Use case

The `wallet/createwitness` method is used for:

* Registering an account as a witness to participate in TRON network governance.
* Setting up block production capabilities for earning rewards from the network.
* Establishing a public presence for community voting and trust building.
* Preparing to compete for one of the 27 Super Representative positions.
* Contributing to network security and decentralization through validation services.
* Building reputation and credibility within the TRON ecosystem.

<Note>
This method only creates the witness registration transaction. You must sign the transaction and use `wallet/broadcasttransaction` to complete the witness registration. Becoming an active block producer requires receiving votes from TRX holders.
