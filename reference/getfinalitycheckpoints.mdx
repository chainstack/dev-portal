openapi: /openapi/ethereum_beacon_chain_api/state/getFinalityCheckpoints.json GET
  /0a9d79d93fb2f4a4b1e04695da2b77a7/eth/v1/beacon/states/{state_id}/finality_checkpoints
---

The `/eth/v1/beacon/states/{state_id}/finality_checkpoints` endpoint retrieves the finality checkpoints of a specified Beacon Chain state. These checkpoints are critical in understanding the finality status of various epochs in the Ethereum PoS mechanism.

## Parameters

* `state_id` — the state identifier for which finality checkpoint information is requested. Acceptable values for `state_id` include:
  + `head` — represents the current head of the chain from the node's perspective.
  + `genesis` — the genesis state of the Beacon Chain.
  + `finalized` — the most recent state that has been finalized and is unlikely to undergo any further changes.
  + `justified` — the most recent state that has been justified, which is a stage preceding finalization.
  + `<slot>` — a specific time slot in the Ethereum protocol.
  + `<hex encoded stateRoot with 0x prefix>` — the specific state root, encoded in hexadecimal.

## Response

The response includes an object with the following properties:

* `data` — an object containing finality checkpoint information for the specified state:
  + `previous_justified` — an object representing the last justified checkpoint before the current epoch. It contains:
    - `epoch` — the epoch number of this justified checkpoint.
    - `root` — the block root of this justified checkpoint.
  + `current_justified` — an object representing the current justified checkpoint. It contains:
    - `epoch` — the epoch number of the current justified checkpoint.
    - `root` — the block root of the current justified checkpoint.
  + `finalized` — an object representing the current finalized checkpoint. It contains:
    - `epoch` — the epoch number of the finalized checkpoint.
    - `root` — the block root of the finalized checkpoint.
