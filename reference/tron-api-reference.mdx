## What is the TRON protocol?

TRON is a decentralized blockchain platform designed to build a free, global digital content entertainment system with distributed storage technology. TRON enables cost-effective sharing of digital content and supports smart contracts, various kinds of blockchain systems, and decentralized applications (DApps). The platform uses a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism for high throughput and scalability.

## What is the TRON API

The TRON API allows developers to interact with the TRON blockchain network to build applications. It provides comprehensive functionality for managing accounts, transactions, smart contracts, and blockchain data.

The TRON API supports both HTTP API endpoints and JSON-RPC methods compatible with Ethereum, making it easy for developers familiar with Ethereum to work with TRON.

## Key features

- **Account Management** — create and manage TRON accounts with full control over permissions and resources
- **Transaction Processing** — broadcast and track transactions on the TRON network
- **Smart Contract Interaction** — deploy and interact with smart contracts including TRC20 tokens
- **Resource Management** — manage bandwidth and energy resources through staking mechanisms
- **Shielded Transactions** — support for privacy-preserving shielded TRC20 transactions
- **Governance Participation** — participate in network governance through witness voting and proposals

## How to start using the TRON API

You need access to a TRON RPC node to use the TRON API.

Follow these steps to sign up on Chainstack, deploy a TRON RPC node, and find your endpoint credentials:

<Steps>
<Step>
[Sign up with Chainstack](https://console.chainstack.com/user/account/create).
</Step>
<Step>
[Deploy a node](/docs/manage-your-networks#join-a-public-network).
</Step>
<Step>
[View node access and credentials](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).
</Step>
</Steps>
Now, you can connect to the TRON blockchain and use the TRON API to build.

## API categories

The TRON API is organized into several categories:

- **Wallet operations** — core wallet functions for address validation, transaction creation, and broadcasting
- **Account management** — account creation, updates, and permission management
- **Resource management** — bandwidth and energy staking, delegation, and withdrawal
- **Block operations** — retrieve block information and monitor the blockchain
- **Transaction operations** — query and track transactions
- **Smart contracts** — deploy and interact with smart contracts
- **Shielded contracts** — privacy-preserving shielded TRC20 operations
- **Witness and governance** — network governance and witness management
- **Assets and exchanges** — TRC10 token operations and decentralized exchange functions
- **JSON-RPC** — Ethereum-compatible JSON-RPC endpoints for Web3 integration
