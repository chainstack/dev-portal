title: eth_newFilter | Cronos
openapi: /openapi/cronos_node_api/eth_newFilter.json POST /b9b0fb92029d58b396139a9e89cf479b
---

Cronos API method that generates a filter object based on the filter parameters. It returns a filter ID, which can be used to retrieve the filter results using the `eth_getFilterChanges` method. By creating a filter for specific events, developers can receive notifications when those events occur and use them to trigger actions in their applications.

## Parameters

* `object` — the filter parameters:
  + `fromBlock` — (optional, default: `latest`) integer that specifies the starting block number from which the logs should be fetched.
  + `toBlock` — (optional, default: `latest`) integer that specifies the ending block number until which the logs should be fetched.
  + `address` — (optional) the contract address from which the logs should be fetched. It can be a single address or an array of addresses.
  + `topics` — (optional) an array of `DATA` topics. The event topics for which the logs should be fetched. It can be a single topic or an array of topics.
  + `blockhash` — (optional) the hash of the specific block. Limits logs to a specific block with a 32-byte hash value. It takes precedence over `fromBlock` and `toBlock`.

<Note>
**Possible tags forfromBlockandtoBlock**

* `latest` — the most recent block in the blockchain and the current state of the blockchain at the most recent block.
* `safe` — the block that received justification from the beacon chain. Although this block could be involved in a chain reorganization, it would necessitate either a coordinated attack by the majority of validators or an instance of severe propagation latency.
* `finalized` — the block accepted as canonical by more than 2/3 of the validators. A chain reorganization is extremely unlikely, and it would require at least 1/3 of the staked ETH to be burned.
* `earliest` — the earliest available or genesis block.
* `pending` — the pending state and transactions block. The current state of transactions that have been broadcast to the network but have not yet been included in a block.

See the [default block parameter](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block) and [How The Merge Impacts Ethereum’s Application Layer](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer).
</Note>


## Response

* `result` — a hexadecimal string representing the ID of the newly created filter

<Warning>
The filters created are stored on the blockchain client instance. The filter is automatically deleted if not polled within a certain time (5 minutes by default).

## `eth_newFilter` code examples

<Note>
Note that the `web3.eth.filter` methods have been deprecated and replaced with the `web3.eth.subscribe` in web3.js. See [web3.js subscriptions](/api-reference/ethereum-web3js-subscriptions-methods).

```javascript ethers.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);

const filter = {
  toBlock: 'latest',
  address: '0x5C7F8A570d578ED84E63fdFA7b1eE72dEae1AE23',
  topics: ['0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef']
};

const createFilter = async () => {
  try {
    const filterId = await provider.send('eth_newFilter', [filter]);
    console.log(filterId); // the filter ID returned by eth_newFilter
    return filterId

const createFilter = async () => {
  try {
    const filterId = await provider.send('eth_newFilter', [filter]);
    console.log(filterId); // the filter ID returned by eth_newFilter
    return filterId
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};

createFilter();
```

## Use case

You can use `eth_newFilter` to create a filter for a specific action on a smart contract, for example, to monitor the transfer transactions from the [Wrapped CRO token](https://cronoscan.com/token/0x5c7f8a570d578ed84e63fdfa7b1ee72deae1ae23).

The idea is to create a filter using the `eth_newFilter` method to monitor an ERC-20 smart contract, WCRO in this case.
