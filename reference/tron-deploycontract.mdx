## Parameters

* `owner_address` — address of the account deploying the contract in hexadecimal format
* `abi` — contract ABI (Application Binary Interface) as a JSON string defining contract methods and events
* `bytecode` — compiled contract bytecode in hexadecimal format
* `parameter` — (optional) constructor parameters encoded in hexadecimal format
* `call_value` — (optional) amount of TRX to transfer to the contract during deployment (in SUN, 1 TRX = 1,000,000 SUN)
* `consume_user_resource_percent` — (optional) percentage of caller's resources used for contract calls (0-100, default 100)
* `fee_limit` — (optional) maximum energy fee willing to pay for deployment (in SUN)
* `origin_energy_limit` — (optional) energy limit provided by the contract creator for future calls
* `name` — (optional) human-readable name for the contract

## Response

* `visible` — boolean indicating whether addresses are in visible format
* `txID` — unique transaction ID for the deployment transaction
* `raw_data` — raw transaction data containing all deployment parameters
* `raw_data_hex` — raw transaction data encoded in hexadecimal format

## Use case

The `wallet/deploycontract` method is used for:

* Deploying new smart contracts to the TRON blockchain.
* Creating TRC20 tokens, NFT contracts, and other decentralized applications.
* Setting up contract resource limits and fee structures during deployment.
* Preparing deployment transactions that can be signed offline for security.
* Building deployment tools and contract management platforms.
* Establishing smart contract infrastructure for DApps and services.

<Note>
This method only creates the deployment transaction. You must sign the transaction and use `wallet/broadcasttransaction` to actually deploy the contract to the network.
