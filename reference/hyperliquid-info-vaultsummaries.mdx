The vault information system is split between multiple endpoints:
- This `vaultSummaries` endpoint returns vaults that are less than 2 hours old
- For hourly snapshots of all vaults, use `https://stats-data.hyperliquid.xyz/Mainnet/vaults`
- For the most recent data on any specific vault, use the [`vaultDetails`](/reference/hyperliquid-info-vault-details) endpoint

See also: [`vaultDetails`](/reference/hyperliquid-info-vault-details) for comprehensive information about a specific vault.
