**Data availability**

This endpoint returns all available vaults in the system. If the response is an empty array, it indicates that no vaults are currently deployed on the network.

For detailed information about a specific vault, use the [`vaultDetails`](/reference/hyperliquid-info-vault-details) endpoint.
</Note>

## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"vaultSummaries"` to retrieve vault summaries.

## Response

The response is an array of vault summary objects containing the following fields:

### Vault identification

* `name` (string) — Name of the vault
* `vaultAddress` (string) — Vault's blockchain address (42-character hexadecimal)
* `leader` (string) — Address of the vault leader/manager

### Vault metrics

* `tvl` (string) — Total Value Locked in the vault
* `isClosed` (boolean) — Whether the vault is closed to new deposits
* `createTimeMillis` (number) — Timestamp when vault was created (in milliseconds since Unix epoch)

### Relationship information

* `relationship` (object) — Vault relationship structure
  * `type` (string) — Type of vault relationship: `"normal"`, `"child"`, or `"parent"`
  * `data` (object, optional) — Additional relationship data
    * `childAddresses` (array of strings) — If parent vault, contains addresses of child vaults

### Understanding vault relationships

**Vault types:**
- **Normal vaults**: Standard standalone vaults
- **Parent vaults**: Vaults that manage or control other child vaults
- **Child vaults**: Vaults that are controlled by a parent vault

**Vault status:**
- **Open vaults**: `isClosed: false` - accepting new deposits
- **Closed vaults**: `isClosed: true` - not accepting new deposits

## Use case

The `info` endpoint with `type: "vaultSummaries"` is essential for applications that need to:

* **Vault discovery**: Browse all available vaults in the system
* **TVL analysis**: Monitor total value locked across different vaults
* **Vault status**: Check which vaults are open or closed for deposits
* **Relationship mapping**: Understand parent-child vault relationships
* **Vault listing**: Build interfaces showing all available vaults
* **Leader tracking**: Identify vault managers and their addresses
* **Historical analysis**: Track when vaults were created
* **Vault hierarchies**: Map complex vault structures with parent-child relationships
* **System overview**: Get a complete picture of all vaults in the ecosystem
* **Integration points**: Feed vault data into portfolio management systems
* **Monitoring systems**: Track new vault deployments and closures
* **Data aggregation**: Collect comprehensive vault metadata for analysis

This endpoint provides the foundational data needed to understand the complete vault ecosystem on Hyperliquid, serving as the primary discovery mechanism for all available vaults.
