Executing and simulating transactions on the Monad blockchain can be done by using the following methods:

  <Card title="eth_createAccessList" icon="angle-right" iconType="solid" href="/reference/monad-createaccesslist" horizontal/>
</CardGroup>

These methods can be used for:

* **Smart contract interaction** — execute read-only calls to smart contracts without creating a transaction on the blockchain.
* **Transaction simulation** — test transaction execution before broadcasting to ensure expected behavior.
* **Transaction broadcasting** — send signed transactions to the network for processing and inclusion in blocks.
* **DApp development** — integrate transaction execution capabilities into decentralized applications.
