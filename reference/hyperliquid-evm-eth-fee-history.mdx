## Parameters

The method takes three parameters:

1. **Block count** - Number of blocks to retrieve fee history for
2. **Newest block** - The newest block to include in the range
3. **Reward percentiles** - Array of percentiles for priority fee rewards

### Parameter details

* `blockCount` (string, required) — Number of blocks in the requested range as a hexadecimal string (maximum 1024)
* `newestBlock` (string, required) — Block identifier: `"latest"`, `"earliest"`, `"pending"`, or a specific block number in hexadecimal
* `rewardPercentiles` (array, optional) — Array of percentile values (0-100) for priority fee rewards

## Response

The method returns historical fee data for the specified block range.

### Response structure

**Fee history object:**
- `oldestBlock` — The oldest block number in the range as a hexadecimal string
- `baseFeePerGas` — Array of base fees per gas for each block (including one extra for the next block)
- `gasUsedRatio` — Array of gas used ratios for each block (0.0 to 1.0)
- `reward` — Array of priority fee rewards at specified percentiles for each block

### Data interpretation

**Base fee analysis:**
- Base fees adjust automatically based on network congestion
- Higher base fees indicate network congestion
- Use base fee trends for gas price prediction
- Base fee array includes one extra element for the next block

**Gas usage patterns:**
- Gas used ratio indicates block fullness (0.0 = empty, 1.0 = full)
- Higher ratios suggest network congestion
- Consistent high ratios may indicate sustained demand
- Use for capacity planning and congestion analysis

**Priority fee insights:**
- On Hyperliquid, priority fees are currently always zero
- Percentile data will reflect this zero priority fee structure
- Transaction ordering is not based on priority fees
- Focus on base fee analysis for gas price optimization

## Usage example

### Basic implementation

```javascript
// Get fee history from Hyperliquid
const getFeeHistory = async (blockCount = 4, newestBlock = 'latest', percentiles = [25, 50, 75]) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/YOUR_ENDPOINT/evm', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      method: 'eth_feeHistory',
      params: [`0x${blockCount.toString(16)}`, newestBlock, percentiles],
      id: 1
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.result;
};

// Analyze fee trends
const analyzeFeeHistory = async () => {
  try {
    const feeHistory = await getFeeHistory();
    
    // Convert base fees from hex to decimal (in gwei)
    const baseFees = feeHistory.baseFeePerGas.map(fee => 
      parseInt(fee, 16) / 1e9
    );
    
    // Analyze gas usage ratios
    const avgGasUsage = feeHistory.gasUsedRatio.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / feeHistory.gasUsedRatio.length;
    
    // Note: Priority fees are always zero on Hyperliquid
    const priorityFees = feeHistory.reward.map(block => 
      block.map(fee => parseInt(fee, 16) / 1e9)
    );
    
    return {
      oldestBlock: parseInt(feeHistory.oldestBlock, 16),
      baseFees: baseFees,
      averageGasUsage: avgGasUsage,
      priorityFees: priorityFees, // Will be all zeros on Hyperliquid
      recommendation: {
        baseFee: Math.max(...baseFees) * 1.1, // Add 10% buffer
        priorityFee: 0 // Always zero on Hyperliquid
      }
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Fee history analysis failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};

// Usage
analyzeFeeHistory()
  .then(analysis => {
    console.log('Fee Analysis:', analysis);
    console.log(`Recommended base fee: ${analysis.recommendation.baseFee.toFixed(2)} gwei`);
    console.log(`Priority fee: ${analysis.recommendation.priorityFee} gwei (always zero on Hyperliquid)`);
  })
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

## Hyperliquid-specific considerations

### Priority fees

**Important limitation:**
- Priority fees are always zero on Hyperliquid
- `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` always returns zero
- Transaction ordering is not based on priority fees
- Focus on base fee optimization for cost management

### Fee optimization

**Base fee analysis:**
- Monitor base fee trends for optimal transaction timing
- Use gas usage ratios to identify network congestion
- Plan batch operations during low base fee periods
- Implement base fee-based cost optimization strategies

## Use cases

The `eth_feeHistory` method is essential for applications that need to:

* **Gas price estimation**: Calculate optimal gas prices for transactions
* **Wallet applications**: Provide users with fee estimation and recommendations
* **DeFi protocols**: Optimize transaction costs for automated operations
* **Trading platforms**: Minimize transaction costs for high-frequency operations
* **Analytics platforms**: Analyze network congestion and fee trends
* **Cost optimization**: Schedule transactions during low-fee periods
* **Fee prediction**: Build predictive models for future gas prices
* **Network monitoring**: Track network health and congestion patterns
* **Arbitrage bots**: Optimize transaction timing for profitability
* **Portfolio management**: Calculate transaction costs for portfolio operations
* **Automated systems**: Implement dynamic fee adjustment strategies
* **Research tools**: Study network economics and fee market dynamics
* **Development tools**: Test applications under various fee conditions
* **Infrastructure services**: Provide fee estimation APIs to other applications
* **Compliance tools**: Monitor transaction costs for regulatory reporting
* **Risk management**: Assess fee volatility risks for operations
* **Educational platforms**: Demonstrate gas market concepts and dynamics
* **Optimization services**: Provide fee optimization recommendations
* **Monitoring systems**: Alert on significant fee changes or anomalies

This method provides comprehensive fee market data, enabling cost-effective and efficient transaction management on the Hyperliquid EVM platform.

<Note>
On Hyperliquid, priority fees are always zero (`eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` always returns zero). Fee history data reflects past network conditions and may not predict future fees accurately during periods of high volatility. Focus on base fee analysis for gas price optimization.
