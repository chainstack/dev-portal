## Parameters

This method takes no parameters.

## Returns

Returns the maximum priority fee per gas as a hexadecimal string. On Hyperliquid, this is always `"0x0"`.

<Warning>
On Hyperliquid, priority fees are always zero. The network uses only base fees for transaction pricing, so setting a priority fee will not affect transaction inclusion speed or priority.
