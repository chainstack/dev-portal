description: "The debug and trace APIs are used by developers to debug and analyze smart contracts and transactions. The debug API allows for code execution simulation, while the `arbtrace` API traces contract execution and gathers data on various performance metrics."

Developers can access the debug and trace tools on the Arbitrum blockchain with the following methods:

Arbitrum nodes with debug and trace APIs enabled will expose the `debug_*` and `arbtrace_*` methods.

<Info>
  Blocks older than 22,207,815th were added to the chain before Nitro migration and cannot be queried with Geth methods. Starting from block 22,207,815, Arbitrum migrated to Nitro which made Geth `debug_*` methods available for newer blocks.

Use the following methods for calling on blocks prior to 22,207,815:

## Pre-built tracers

<Info>
  ### Custom tracers are available on customized dedicated nodes only

  Custom JavaScript tracers outside of the ones listed below are available as customized solutions on the [Enterprise plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) on [dedicated nodes](/docs/dedicated-node).
</Info>

Developers can customize the type of tracing using various debug and trace methods, and there are numerous pre-built tracers available to choose from. Here is a list of the pre-built tracers that can be utilized:

### `4byteTracer`

This tracer looks for function signatures that are 4 bytes long during contract execution and gathers information about the method identifiers and the size of the provided data. This information can be helpful in matching a signature against the data size.

### `callTracer`

This tracer extracts information about all internal calls made by a transaction, providing visibility into how contracts interact with each other.

### `prestateTracer`

This tracer returns sufficient information about an account to create a local execution of the transaction. This procedure runs the given transaction again and monitors every aspect of the state that is modified or accessed during execution.

### `noopTracer`

This tracer does nothing but respond with a blank object. This a no operations tracer for testing setup.

### `stylusTracer`

This tracer is for debugging Stylus contracts by tracing calls between the WasmVM and EVM, allowing developers to fully understand their Stylus transactions. See also [debug\_traceTransaction with stylusTracer](/reference/arbitrum_node_api/debug_and_trace/arbtrace_transaction).
