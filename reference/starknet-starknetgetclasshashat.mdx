## Parameters

* `address` — the address of the contract.
* `block_id` — the hash of the requested block, or number (height) of the requested block, or a block tag:

  + `latest` — the most recent block in the blockchain and the current state of the blockchain at the most recent block. A chain reorganization is to be expected.
  + `safe` — the block that received justification from the beacon chain. Although this block could be involved in a chain reorganization, it would necessitate either a coordinated attack by the majority of validators or an instance of severe propagation latency.
  + `finalized` — the block accepted as canonical by more than 2/3 of the validators. A chain reorganization is extremely unlikely, and it would require at least 1/3 of the staked ETH to be burned.
  + `earliest` — the earliest available or genesis block
  + `pending` — the pending state and transactions block. The current state of transactions that have been broadcast to the network but have not yet been included in a block.

## Response

* `result` — the hash of the class at the given address, represented as a hexadecimal string.

## Use case

A practical use case for `starknet_getClassHashAt` is to verify the type of contract deployed at a given address. This can be useful for developers to ensure that the correct contract has been deployed at the expected address.
