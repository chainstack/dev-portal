## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"liquidatable"` to check user's liquidation status.
* `user` (string, required) — Address in 42-character hexadecimal format (e.g., `0x31ca8395cf837de08b24da3f660e77761dfb974b`).

## Response

The response is an object containing liquidation status and risk metrics:

### Liquidation status fields

* `liquidatable` (boolean) — Whether the user's positions are currently liquidatable:
  * `true` — Positions are at risk and may be liquidated
  * `false` — Positions are healthy and not at liquidation risk

### Risk metrics (optional fields)

* `leverage` (string) — Current effective leverage ratio of the user's positions
* `marginUsed` (string) — Amount of margin currently used for open positions
* `marginRemaining` (string) — Amount of available margin before liquidation threshold
* `accountValue` (string) — Total account value including unrealized profit and loss
* `totalRawUsd` (string) — Total raw USD value of the account before adjustments
* `totalNtlPos` (string) — Total notional position value across all assets

### Understanding liquidation risk

**Liquidation occurs when:**
- Account leverage exceeds maximum allowed ratios
- Margin requirements are not met due to adverse price movements
- Account value falls below maintenance margin requirements

**Risk levels:**
- **Safe**: `liquidatable: false` with sufficient margin remaining
- **At Risk**: `liquidatable: true` indicating immediate liquidation danger
- **Critical**: High leverage with minimal margin remaining
