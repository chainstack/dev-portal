## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"perpsAtOpenInterestCap"` to retrieve perpetuals at open interest cap.

## Response

The response is an array of perpetual contract symbols that have reached their open interest limit:

* **Symbols array** (array of strings) — List of perpetual contract symbols at capacity
  * Each element is a string representing the contract symbol (e.g., "BADGER", "CANTO", "FTM")
  * Empty array indicates no contracts are currently at their open interest cap
  * Symbols represent the underlying asset of the perpetual contract

### Understanding open interest caps

**Open interest limits:**
- Maximum total position size allowed for a perpetual contract
- Protects against excessive concentration risk and market manipulation
- Dynamically adjusted based on market conditions and liquidity
- Applied to the sum of all long and short positions

**Market implications:**
- Contracts at cap cannot accept new positions in the dominant direction
- May still allow position reductions or opposite-direction trades
- Indicates high market interest and potential volatility
- Can affect price discovery and arbitrage opportunities

**Risk management:**
- Prevents excessive leverage concentration in single assets
- Maintains market stability during high volatility periods
- Protects the protocol from potential liquidation cascades
- Ensures balanced exposure across different assets

**Trading considerations:**
- New positions may be rejected for capped contracts
- Existing positions can still be closed or reduced
- Alternative trading strategies may be required
- Monitor for cap changes as market conditions evolve

* **Trading platforms**: Display which contracts have position restrictions
* **Risk management**: Monitor exposure limits across perpetual contracts
* **Market analysis**: Identify high-demand contracts and market sentiment
* **Order routing**: Avoid submitting orders for capacity-constrained contracts
* **Portfolio management**: Adjust strategies based on available contract capacity
* **Market making**: Understand liquidity constraints for automated strategies
* **Compliance monitoring**: Track position limits for regulatory purposes
* **User notifications**: Alert traders about contract availability changes
* **Strategy optimization**: Adapt trading algorithms to capacity constraints
* **Market research**: Analyze which assets are experiencing high demand
* **Liquidity analysis**: Understand market depth and capacity utilization
* **Position planning**: Plan entry and exit strategies around capacity limits
* **Arbitrage detection**: Identify potential arbitrage opportunities from caps
* **Risk assessment**: Evaluate concentration risk across available contracts
