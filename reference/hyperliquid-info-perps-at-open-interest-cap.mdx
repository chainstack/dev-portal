## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"perpsAtOpenInterestCap"` to retrieve perpetuals at open interest cap.

## Response

The response is an array of perpetual contract symbols that have reached their open interest limit:

* **Symbols array** (array of strings) — List of perpetual contract symbols at capacity
  * Each element is a string representing the contract symbol (e.g., "BADGER", "CANTO", "FTM")
  * Empty array indicates no contracts are currently at their open interest cap
  * Symbols represent the underlying asset of the perpetual contract

### Understanding open interest caps

**Open interest limits:**
- Maximum total position size allowed for a perpetual contract
- Protects against excessive concentration risk and market manipulation
- Dynamically adjusted based on market conditions and liquidity
- Applied to the sum of all long and short positions

**Market implications:**
- Contracts at cap cannot accept new positions in the dominant direction
- May still allow position reductions or opposite-direction trades
- Indicates high market interest and potential volatility
- Can affect price discovery and arbitrage opportunities

**Risk management:**
- Prevents excessive leverage concentration in single assets
- Maintains market stability during high volatility periods
- Protects the protocol from potential liquidation cascades
- Ensures balanced exposure across different assets

**Trading considerations:**
- New positions may be rejected for capped contracts
- Existing positions can still be closed or reduced
- Alternative trading strategies may be required
- Monitor for cap changes as market conditions evolve

## Use case

The `info` endpoint with `type: "perpsAtOpenInterestCap"` is essential for applications that need to:

* **Trading platforms**: Display which contracts have position restrictions
* **Risk management**: Monitor exposure limits across perpetual contracts
* **Market analysis**: Identify high-demand contracts and market sentiment
* **Order routing**: Avoid submitting orders for capacity-constrained contracts
* **Portfolio management**: Adjust strategies based on available contract capacity
* **Market making**: Understand liquidity constraints for automated strategies
* **Compliance monitoring**: Track position limits for regulatory purposes
* **User notifications**: Alert traders about contract availability changes
* **Strategy optimization**: Adapt trading algorithms to capacity constraints
* **Market research**: Analyze which assets are experiencing high demand
* **Liquidity analysis**: Understand market depth and capacity utilization
* **Position planning**: Plan entry and exit strategies around capacity limits
* **Arbitrage detection**: Identify potential arbitrage opportunities from caps
* **Risk assessment**: Evaluate concentration risk across available contracts

This endpoint is particularly valuable for active traders managing large positions, algorithmic trading systems that need to avoid rejected orders, risk management systems monitoring exposure limits, and market analysis tools tracking demand patterns across perpetual contracts on the Hyperliquid network.
