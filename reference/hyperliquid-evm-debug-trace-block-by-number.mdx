</Info>

The `debug_traceBlockByNumber` method returns detailed trace information for all transactions in a specific block identified by block number. This method provides comprehensive debugging information including call traces, gas usage, and execution details for each transaction.

## Parameters

* `blockNumber` (string, required) — The block number in hexadecimal format (e.g., `"0x1"`), or one of the tags: `"latest"`, `"earliest"`, `"pending"`.
* `tracerConfig` (object, optional) — Tracer configuration:
  * `tracer` (string) — Tracer type (`"callTracer"` or `"prestateTracer"`).

## Response

The response is an array of trace objects, one per transaction in the block. With `callTracer`, each trace contains:

* `type` (string) — Call type (e.g., `"CALL"`, `"DELEGATECALL"`).
* `from` (string) — Sender address.
* `to` (string) — Recipient address.
* `value` (string) — Value transferred in wei (hex).
* `gas` (string) — Gas provided (hex).
* `gasUsed` (string) — Gas used (hex).
* `input` (string) — Call input data.
* `output` (string) — Call output data.

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "debug_traceBlockByNumber", "params": ["0x1", {"tracer": "callTracer"}], "id": 1}' \

```

## Example response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": []
}
```

## Use case

The `debug_traceBlockByNumber` method is useful for:

* Debugging all transactions in a specific block by number
* Analyzing gas usage patterns across block transactions
* Tracing internal calls and value transfers within a block
* Building block explorers with detailed execution traces
