Here's an example of getting the top 10 accounts:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  curl -X GET \
    'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v3/topAccountsByBalance?limit=10' \
    -H 'accept: application/json'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  The `address_book` in the response will include names for well-known addresses like exchanges and major contracts, making it easier to identify the top holders.
