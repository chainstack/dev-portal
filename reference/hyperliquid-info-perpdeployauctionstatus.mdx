## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"perpDeployAuctionStatus"` to retrieve perpetual deployment auction status.

## Response

The response is an object containing auction timing and gas information:

### Timing information

* `startTimeSeconds` (integer) — Auction start time in seconds since epoch
* `durationSeconds` (integer) — Duration of the auction in seconds

### Gas information

* `startGas` (string) — Starting gas amount for the auction
* `currentGas` (string) — Current gas amount
* `endGas` (string or null) — Ending gas amount (null if auction is ongoing)

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "perpDeployAuctionStatus"}' \
  https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/4f8d8f4040bdacd1577bff8058438274/info
```

## Example response

```json
{
  "startTimeSeconds": 1747656000,
  "durationSeconds": 111600,
  "startGas": "500.0",
  "currentGas": "500.0",
  "endGas": null
}
```

## Use case

The `info` endpoint with `type: "perpDeployAuctionStatus"` is essential for applications that need to:

* **Auction timing**: Monitor the timing and duration of perpetual deployment auctions
* **Gas tracking**: Track gas amounts and changes during auction processes
* **System monitoring**: Monitor the status of the auction system infrastructure
* **Timeline calculation**: Calculate auction progress and remaining time
* **Integration timing**: Plan system integrations around auction schedules
* **Status reporting**: Report on auction system operational status
* **Data analysis**: Analyze auction patterns and gas consumption trends
* **Monitoring dashboards**: Display auction timing information in management interfaces

This endpoint provides basic timing and gas information for the perpetual deployment auction system on Hyperliquid.
