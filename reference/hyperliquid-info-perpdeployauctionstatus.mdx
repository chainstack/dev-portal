* `durationSeconds` (integer) — Duration of the auction in seconds

### Gas information

* `startGas` (string) — Starting gas amount for the auction
* `currentGas` (string) — Current gas amount
* `endGas` (string or null) — Ending gas amount (null if auction is ongoing)

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
