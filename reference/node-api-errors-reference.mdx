| 400 | Bad Request | Your request is invalid. Make sure your request is properly formatted and this is a valid request. |
| 401 | Authorization Required | The credentials you provide to access your node endpoint are absent or incorrect. See how to [know your node credentials](https://docs.chainstack.com/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials). |
