Create fully signed shielded TRX transactions client-side. Public TRON nodes generally do not expose an RPC for `wallet/createshieldedtransaction`; attempting to POST to that route returns HTTP 405. Build shielded transactions locally using TRON shielded transaction libraries.

## Parameters

* `transparent_from_address` — the transparent TRX address sending funds (optional)
* `from_amount` — the amount to send from transparent address (in sun)
* `spend_authority_signature` — array of spending authority signatures for shielded inputs
* `ask` — authentication secret key for transaction signing
* `nsk` — nullifier secret key for creating nullifiers
* `ovk` — outgoing viewing key for transaction encryption
* `to_address` — recipient shielded address
* `to_amount` — amount to send to shielded address (in sun)

## Response

* `txID` — the transaction ID hash
* `raw_data_hex` — the raw transaction data in hexadecimal format
* `raw_data` — the structured raw transaction data

## Use case

The `wallet/createshieldedtransaction` method is used for:

* Creating fully signed shielded TRX transactions for immediate broadcast
* Transferring TRX between transparent and shielded addresses
* Supporting complete privacy-preserving TRX transactions
* Enabling applications to create ready-to-broadcast shielded transactions

## Client-side implementation

<Info>
Public nodes typically return HTTP 405 for this route. Build shielded transactions client-side using TRON privacy libraries (e.g., tronweb with shielded support) or Sapling-compatible implementations. Generate and sign the transaction locally, then broadcast via `wallet/broadcasttransaction`.
</Info>

Use TRON's shielded transaction libraries to:

1. Construct the shielded inputs (spends) and outputs (receives) using your key material (ask, nsk, ovk)
2. Generate the zero-knowledge proof parameters offline
3. Sign the transaction with spending authority signatures
4. Build the complete signed raw transaction structure
5. Broadcast the transaction via `wallet/broadcasttransaction`
