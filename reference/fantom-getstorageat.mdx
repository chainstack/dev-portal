title: eth_getStorageAt | Fantom
openapi: /openapi/fantom_node_api/eth_getStorageAt.json POST /4ab982aa70a7baead515ffdb5915df3f
---

Fantom API method that returns the data stored at a specific storage slot within a smart contract. It can help developers read a smart contract's internal state, like user data or balances, to inform decisions and build more advanced applications that interact with smart contracts on the blockchain.

## Parameters

* `address` — the address of the smart contract to query
* `quantity` — the index of the storage position to retrieve the data from
* `quantity or tag` — the integer of a block encoded as hexadecimal or the string with:

  + `latest` — the most recent block in the blockchain and the current state of the blockchain at the most recent block. A chain reorganization is to be expected.
  + `safe` — the block that received justification from the beacon chain. Although this block could be involved in a chain reorganization, it would necessitate either a coordinated attack by the majority of validators or an instance of severe propagation latency.
  + `finalized` — the block accepted as canonical by more than 2/3 of the validators. A chain reorganization is extremely unlikely, and it would require at least 1/3 of the staked amount to be burned.
  + `earliest` — the earliest available or genesis block.
  + `pending` — the pending state and transactions block. The current state of transactions that have been broadcast to the network but have not yet been included in a block.

<Note>
See the [default block parameter](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block) and [How The Merge Impacts Ethereum’s Application Layer](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer).
</Note>


## Response

`data` — the data stored in the storage slot. Returned as a hexadecimal string.

## `eth_getStorageAt` code examples

The following example returns the storage value at slot `2` from the [WFTM Token on the Fantom mainnet](https://ftmscan.com/token/0x21be370d5312f44cb42ce377bc9b8a0cef1a4c83#readContract). In this case, this is the total supply value.

This method can retrieve the different storage values in time by querying different blocks in the past. Note that to query a state in the past, you need an [archive node](https://chainstack.com/evm-nodes-a-dive-into-the-full-vs-archive-mode).

<Note>
cURL needs a `HEX String` starting with `0x` to identify the block if you want to use a hex integer block number as a parameter.  
For example, block number `14000000` will be `0xD59F80`. Use the [Chainstack EVM Knife](https://web3tools.chainstacklabs.com/hexadecimal-decimal) to make those conversions.

## Use case

One use case for `eth_getStorageAt` is analyzing how the value stored at a specific storage slot of a smart contract changes over time. For example, a developer may want to track the change in a specific variable of a smart contract, such as the total supply of a token, and perform some analysis on it.
