<Warning>
The `ovk` must be provided **without the 0x prefix** and must be exactly 64 hexadecimal characters (32 bytes). The `shielded_TRC20_contract_address` must be in **hex format** (starting with 41), not base58 format. There is a block range limit: `(end_block_index - start_block_index) <= 1000`.
</Warning>

## Parameters

* `start_block_index` — the starting block number for scanning (inclusive)
* `end_block_index` — the ending block number for scanning (exclusive, max 1000 blocks from start)
* `ovk` — the outgoing viewing key for decrypting sent notes (64 hex characters, no `0x` prefix)
* `shielded_TRC20_contract_address` — the shielded TRC20 contract address to scan (hex format starting with 41, no `0x` prefix)

## Response

* `noteTxs` — array of found outgoing shielded note transactions
  * `txid` — transaction ID containing the note
  * `index` — index of the note within the transaction
  * `note` — the decrypted note details
    * `value` — note value
    * `payment_address` — recipient shielded payment address
    * `rcm` — randomness commitment
    * `memo` — optional memo field
  * `position` — position in the merkle tree
  * `is_spent` — whether the note has been spent

## Use case

The `wallet/scanshieldedtrc20notesbyovk` method is used for:

* Tracking outgoing shielded TRC20 payments for transaction history
* Monitoring sent transactions without revealing recipient details
* Building wallet interfaces that show outbound shielded transaction records
* Providing audit trails for shielded transaction activity

<Info>
The outgoing viewing key (ovk) is derived from the spending key (sk) and is used by the sender to view shielded transactions they send. This 256-bit key allows transaction creators to track their outgoing payments without compromising the privacy of recipients.
