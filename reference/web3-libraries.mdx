title: "Web3 Libraries and Tools"
description: "A Web3 library is a tool that allows developers to interact with blockchains. These libraries provide an easy-to-use interface for developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) and interact and retrieve data from a blockchain."

The most popular Web3 libraries are [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/), [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/), and [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/). These libraries are widely used in the Web3 community and provide similar functionality.

## Install a Web3 library

Learn how to install Web3 libraries and connect to a blockchain for developing DApps.

### JavaScript libraries

To install a Web3 JavaScript library, you need node.js installed on your machine:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Install node.js" href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" icon="node" iconType="solid" horizontal />
</CardGroup>

Then you can install the library using npm:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell web3.js
  npm install web3
  ```

  ```shell ethers.js
  npm install ethers
  ```

  ```Text Viem
  npm install viem
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Python libraries

To install and use a Python library, you first need to install Python in your system:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Install Python" href="https://realpython.com/installing-python/" icon="python" iconType="solid" horizontal />
</CardGroup>

Then you can install the library using pip:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell web3.py
  pip install web3
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Get started

To get started with Web3 libraries, you will need to have a basic understanding of the EVM and smart contracts. It is also recommended to have a local development environment set up. Once you have set up your development environment, you can start interacting with different blockchains using the Web3 library of your choice.

### Create a node instance

#### web3.js

To get started with web3.js, you will need to create a provider instance. This can be done by instantiating the `Web3` class and passing in the URL of an Ethereum node deployed with Chainstack. For example:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript web3.js
  const { Web3 } = require("web3");

  const node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
  const web3 = new Web3(node_url);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  In `web3.js` V4, numeric values are returned as `BigInt`, identifiable by the n suffix (e.g., `247n`). This change ensures high-precision handling of large integers in blockchain applications. Remember to either convert these values to standard integers or adapt other values to BigInt when performing mathematical operations.
</Info>

#### ethers.js

Ethers.js supports `ChainstackProvider`. You can create a `ChainstackProvider` instance and connect to Ethereum Mainnet (mainnet), Arbitrum (arbitrum), BNB Smart Chain Mainnet (bnb), Polygon (matic).

For example:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript ethers.js
  const ethers = require("ethers");

  // Create a ChainstackProvider instance for Ethereum mainnet
  const chainstack = new ethers.ChainstackProvider("mainnet"); // Swap 'mainnet' for 'arbitrum', 'bnb' , and 'matic'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Viem

To get started with Viem, set up `client` instance with a `transport`. This can be done with `createPublicClient` and passing in the URL of an Ethereum node deployed with Chainstack. For example:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Viem
  import { createPublicClient, http } from 'viem';

  const publicClient = createPublicClient({
    transport: http('CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL')
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Viem typically adheres to the ES6 standard for module imports.
</Info>

#### web3.py

To start with web3.py, you will need to create a provider instance. This can be done by instantiating the `Web3` class and passing in the URL of an Ethereum node deployed with Chainstack. For example:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python web3.py
  from web3 import Web3

  node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL"
  web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url))
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Once you have created a provider instance, you can use the functions provided by the library to interact with a blockchain.
