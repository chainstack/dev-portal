## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"delegations"` to retrieve user's delegation information.
* `user` (string, required) — Address in 42-character hexadecimal format (e.g., `0x2ba553d9f990a3b66b03b2dc0d030dfc1c061036`).

## Response

The response is an array of delegation objects, each representing an active delegation to a validator:

### Delegation object structure

Each delegation object in the array contains:

* `validator` (string) — The validator's address in 42-character hexadecimal format.
* `amount` (string) — The amount of tokens delegated to this validator.
* `lockedUntilTimestamp` (number) — Timestamp (in milliseconds) until which the delegation is locked.

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "delegations", "user": "0x2ba553d9f990a3b66b03b2dc0d030dfc1c061036"}' \

```

## Example response

```json

    {
        "validator": "0x5ac99df645f3414876c816caa18b2d234024b487",
        "amount": "12060.16529862",
        "lockedUntilTimestamp": 1735466781353
    },
    {
        "validator": "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678",
        "amount": "5000.0",
        "lockedUntilTimestamp": 1735556781353
    }
]
```

## Use case

The `info` endpoint with `type: "delegations"` is essential for applications that need to:

* **Display active delegations**: Show users their current validator delegations and amounts
* **Track delegation amounts**: Monitor how much is delegated to each validator
* **Check lock periods**: Display when delegations will become available for undelegation
* **Portfolio overview**: Provide a simple view of delegation distribution across validators
* **Validator management**: List which validators a user has delegated to
* **Delegation planning**: Help users understand their current delegation commitments
* **Lock time monitoring**: Track when delegations expire and become withdrawable

This endpoint provides basic delegation information and is typically used alongside other staking endpoints like `delegatorSummary` for comprehensive staking portfolio management on the Hyperliquid network.
