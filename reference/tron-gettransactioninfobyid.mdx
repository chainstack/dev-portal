## Parameters

* `value` — the transaction ID (hash) in hexadecimal format

## Response

* `id` — transaction ID (hash)
* `blockNumber` — block number where the transaction was included
* `blockTimeStamp` — timestamp when the block was created (milliseconds)
* `contractResult` — array of smart contract execution results in hex format
* `contract_address` — address of the deployed contract (for contract creation transactions)
* `receipt` — transaction receipt containing:

* `resMessage` — error message if transaction failed (hex-encoded)

## Use case

The `wallet/gettransactioninfobyid` method is used for:

* Getting detailed transaction execution information and resource consumption data.
* Monitoring transaction success/failure status and error messages.
* Analyzing smart contract execution results and event logs.
* Calculating actual fees paid for energy and bandwidth usage.
* Building transaction explorers and analytics tools that need execution details.
* Debugging smart contract interactions by examining logs and results.
