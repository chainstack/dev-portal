* `seqno` (int, optional) — the Masterchain seqno. You can get the Masterchain seqno with [getMasterchainInfo | TON v2](/reference/ton-getmasterchaininfo-v2).

Example with `seqno`:

```shell Shell
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v2/getWalletInformation?address=EQDtFpEwcFAEcRe5mLVh2N6C0x-_hJEM7W61_JLnSF74p4q2&seqno=45792554' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```


## JSON-RPC example

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \

    }
  }'
```


## Parameters

* `address` (string, required) — The address for which wallet information is being requested. Example: `EQDtFpEwcFAEcRe5mLVh2N6C0x-_hJEM7W61_JLnSF74p4q2`.

## Use case

A possible use case for the `getWalletInformation` method in TON is for wallet applications or blockchain explorers that need to display specific information about wallet contracts. This method can be used to show the current balance, wallet type, and transaction sequence number, which are crucial for interacting with the wallet or monitoring its state.
