title: Schedule cancel | Hyperliquid exchange
openapi: /openapi/hyperliquid_node_api/exchange_schedule_cancel.json post /exchange

<Info>
You can only use this endpoint on the official Hyperliquid public API. It is not available through Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support it yet. See [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

<Note>
This endpoint requires signature authentication. See our comprehensive [Authentication via Signatures guide](/docs/hyperliquid-authentication-guide) for implementation details.
</Note>

Schedules an automatic cancel-all operation at a future time, acting as a dead man's switch for risk management. This safety feature ensures all open orders are canceled if your trading system becomes unresponsive.

## Parameters

### Required parameters

* `action` (object, required) — The schedule cancel action object containing:
  * `type` (string) — Must be `"scheduleCancel"`
  * `time` (number, optional) — Unix timestamp in milliseconds when to cancel all orders. Omit to remove existing scheduled cancel

* `nonce` (number, required) — Current timestamp in milliseconds (must be recent)
* `signature` (object, required) — EIP-712 signature of the action

### Optional parameters

* `vaultAddress` (string, optional) — Address when trading on behalf of a vault or subaccount
* `expiresAfter` (number, optional) — Timestamp in milliseconds after which the request is rejected

## Returns

Returns an object with scheduling status:

* `status` — `"ok"` if request processed
* `response` — Contains operation details:
  * `type` — `"scheduleCancel"`

## Scheduling rules

* **Minimum delay** — Scheduled time must be at least 5 seconds in the future
* **Daily limit** — Maximum 10 triggers per day (resets at 00:00 UTC)
* **Cancel operation** — Omit the `time` parameter to remove an existing scheduled cancel
* **Auto-execution** — When triggered, cancels all open orders for the user

## Example request

<CodeGroup>

```shell cURL
# Schedule cancel in 60 seconds
curl -X POST https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/exchange \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": {
      "type": "scheduleCancel",
      "time": 1234567950123
    },
    "nonce": 1234567890123,
    "signature": {...}
  }'

# Remove scheduled cancel
curl -X POST https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/exchange \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": {
      "type": "scheduleCancel"
    },
    "nonce": 1234567890123,
    "signature": {...}
  }'
```

```python Python
from hyperliquid.exchange import Exchange
from hyperliquid.utils import constants
import eth_account
import time

# Initialize with your private key
account = eth_account.Account.from_key("0x...")
exchange = Exchange(account, constants.MAINNET_API_URL)

# Schedule cancel in 60 seconds
future_time = int((time.time() + 60) * 1000)
schedule_result = exchange.schedule_cancel(time=future_time)

# Remove scheduled cancel
remove_result = exchange.schedule_cancel(time=None)

print(schedule_result)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Response example

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "response": {
    "type": "scheduleCancel"
  }
}
```

## Use cases

* **System failure protection** — Automatically cancel orders if your trading system crashes
* **Connection loss safety** — Protect against network disconnections
* **Daily trading limits** — Schedule end-of-day order cleanup
* **Risk management** — Implement automatic position closure during maintenance

## Best practices

1. **Regular heartbeats** — Continuously push the scheduled cancel forward while your system is healthy
2. **Buffer time** — Set cancellation time with enough buffer (e.g., 30-60 seconds)
3. **Monitor triggers** — Track your daily trigger count to avoid hitting the limit
4. **Graceful shutdown** — Remove scheduled cancels when intentionally stopping your system

<Note>
The dead man's switch is a critical safety feature. Always implement it in production trading systems to prevent orders from remaining open during system failures.
</Note>

<Warning>
Remember the 10 triggers per day limit. If you hit this limit, you won't be able to use the scheduled cancel feature until 00:00 UTC. Plan your heartbeat intervals accordingly.
