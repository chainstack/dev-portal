Base API method `trace_replayBlockTransactions` replays transactions in a specified block individually, returning the trace data for each transaction. This method is invaluable for developers, auditors, and analysts who wish to inspect the execution path of transactions within a block, including calls to other contracts, state changes, and execution outcomes without affecting the live blockchain.

## Parameters

* `blockHash` or `blockNumber` — The hash or number of the block whose transactions you want to replay. This can be specified as a hexadecimal string for the block hash or a hexadecimal or decimal number for the block number.
* `traceTypes` — An array of strings specifying the types of traces to return for each transaction. Common trace types include `"vmTrace"`, `"trace"`, and `"stateDiff"`.

## Response

* `result` — An array containing the trace data for each transaction in the specified block. Each item in the array represents the trace of a single transaction, detailing calls to contracts, value transfers, and other relevant state changes that occurred during its execution.

## Use case

The `trace_replayBlockTransactions` method is particularly useful for conducting detailed analyses of block transactions. Developers can use it to debug contract interactions within a specific block, auditors can use it to verify the correctness and security of transactions, and analysts might use it to study transaction patterns or detect anomalies. This method provides a granular view of transaction execution, which is essential for understanding complex interactions on the blockchain.
