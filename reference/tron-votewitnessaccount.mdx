## Parameters

* `owner_address` — address of the account casting votes. Use base58 with `visible: true`, or hex with `visible: false`.
* `votes` — array of vote allocations, each containing:
  * `vote_address` — witness address to vote for (base58 with `visible: true`, or a 21‑byte hex address starting with `41` when `visible: false`).
  * `vote_count` — number of votes to allocate to this witness.
* `visible` — optional boolean. When `true`, addresses are base58; when `false`, hex. Default is `true`.

## Response

* `visible` — boolean indicating whether addresses are in visible format
* `txID` — unique transaction ID for the voting transaction
* `raw_data` — raw transaction data containing:
  * `contract` — array with witness voting contract details
  * `ref_block_bytes` — reference block bytes for transaction validation
  * `ref_block_hash` — hash of the reference block
  * `expiration` — transaction expiration timestamp
  * `timestamp` — transaction creation timestamp
* `raw_data_hex` — complete transaction data encoded in hexadecimal format

## Use case

The `wallet/votewitnessaccount` method is used for:

* Participating in TRON network governance by voting for preferred witnesses.
* Supporting witnesses that align with your vision for network development.
* Earning voting rewards from witnesses who share profits with their voters.
* Influencing which witnesses become the top 27 Super Representatives.
* Distributing voting power across multiple witnesses for diversification.
* Contributing to network decentralization through democratic participation.

<Note>
You can only vote using frozen TRX balance. You must have TRX frozen for Energy or Bandwidth to be eligible for voting. The total number of votes cannot exceed your frozen TRX balance, and votes can be distributed among multiple witnesses.

## curl example

```shell Shell
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://tron-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/95e61622bf6a8af293978377718e3b77/wallet/votewitnessaccount' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "owner_address": "THPvaUhoh2Qn2y9THCZML3H815hhFhn5YC",
  "votes": [
    { "vote_address": "TDdeM7G4HSxhn2MfovsiMWwXZkiFaHhjMB", "vote_count": 1000000 },
    { "vote_address": "TAybtvPZCSj5kumiU4myD28xBy6WFtkgCu", "vote_count": 500000 }
  ],
  "visible": true
}'
```

<Info>
avoid `Invalid address` by matching address format with `visible`:

- base58 addresses → set `visible: true` (recommended for humans)
- hex addresses → set `visible: false` and use 21‑byte hex (42 hex chars) starting with `41`

to get valid witness addresses, call [`wallet/listwitnesses`](/reference/tron-listwitnesses) and copy candidate addresses from the response.
