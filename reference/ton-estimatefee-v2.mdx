The `estimateFee` method estimates the fee required to send a message to the TON blockchain. This method allows you to calculate expected transaction costs before actually sending the transaction.

## Request body

* `address` (string, required) — The address to send the message from. Example: `EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs`.
* `body` (string, required) — The body of the message in base64 format.
* `init_code` (string, optional) — The init code in base64 format. Required when deploying a new contract.
* `init_data` (string, optional) — The init data in base64 format. Required when deploying a new contract.
* `ignore_chksig` (boolean, optional) — Whether to ignore the signature check. Set to `true` when estimating fees without a valid signature. Default: `true`.

## JSON-RPC

  ```shell shell
  curl -X POST \
    'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v2/jsonRPC' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": 1,
      "method": "estimateFee",
      "params": {
        "address": "EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs",

        "ignore_chksig": true
      }
    }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Response

* `ok` (boolean) — Whether the operation was successful.

* `result` (object) — The result of the operation. Contains:

  * `@type` (string) — The type of the result, typically `query.fees`.
  * `source_fees` (object) — The fees charged to the source account:
    * `in_fwd_fee` (integer) — The incoming forward fee in nanotons.
    * `storage_fee` (integer) — The storage fee in nanotons.
    * `gas_fee` (integer) — The gas fee in nanotons.
    * `fwd_fee` (integer) — The forward fee in nanotons.
  * `destination_fees` (array) — Array of fee objects for destination accounts (for multi-hop messages).
  * `@extra` (string) — Extra information about the operation.

## Use case

The `estimateFee` method is essential for applications that need to calculate transaction costs:

1. Wallet applications can display estimated fees to users before they confirm transactions.
2. Smart contract developers can estimate deployment costs before deploying contracts.
3. DApps can optimize transaction parameters to minimize fees.
4. Trading bots can factor in transaction costs when calculating profitability.
5. Payment services can include accurate fee estimates in invoices.

Here's an example of estimating fees for a simple transaction:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v2/estimateFee' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "address": "EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs",
    "body": "te6cckEBAQEAAgAAAEysuc0=",
    "ignore_chksig": true
  }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  The total fee is approximately the sum of `in_fwd_fee`, `storage_fee`, `gas_fee`, and `fwd_fee`. However, actual fees may vary slightly due to network conditions.
