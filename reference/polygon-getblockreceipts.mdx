title: eth_getBlockReceipts | Polygon
openapi: /openapi/polygon_node_api/transaction_info/eth_getBlockReceipts.json POST /a9bca2f0f84b54086ceebe590316fff3
---

Polygon API method that retrieves all transaction receipts for a given block. Transaction receipts contain information about the execution status of a transaction and can be useful for monitoring the status of transfers or contract execution on the blockchain. This method is available on Erigon only.

## Parameters

* `quantity or tag` — the block hash, block number encoded as hexadecimal, or the string with:

  + `latest` — the most recent block in the blockchain and the current state of the blockchain at the most recent block
  + `earliest` — the earliest available or genesis block
  + `pending` — the pending state and transactions block. The current state of transactions that have been broadcast to the network but have not yet been included in a block.

<Note>
See the [default block parameter](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block).
</Note>


## Response

* `result` — an array of objects with the following fields:
  + `Transaction receipt` — the object with:
    - `blockHash` — the block hash. Identifies the block in which the transaction was included. This field is `null` for transactions that have not yet been included in a block.
    - `blockNumber` — the number of the block in which the transaction was included. This field is `null` for transactions that have not yet been included in a block.
    - `contractAddress` — the address of the contract created by the transaction if it was a contract creation transaction. Otherwise, the value is `null`.
    - `cumulativeGasUsed` — the total amount of gas used in the block until this transaction was executed.
    - `effectiveGasPrice` — the actual value deducted from the sender's account for this transaction.
    - `from` — the address of the sender who initiated the transaction.
    - `gasUsed` — the amount of gas used by this specific transaction alone.
    - `logs` — an array of log objects generated by this transaction, if any. Logs are generated by smart contracts.
    - `logsBloom` — the bloom filter used by light clients to quickly retrieve logs related to the transaction.
    - `status` — the success status of the transaction, represented as `1` for success or `0` for failure.
    - `to` — the address of the recipient of the transaction if it was a transaction to an address. For contract creation transactions, this field is `null`.
    - `transactionHash` — the hash that uniquely identifies the transaction.
    - `transactionIndex` — the index of the transaction within the block.
    - `type` — the [type](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/#types-of-transactions) of the transaction. `0` indicates a regular transfer; `2` indicates a contract creation or smart contract function call.

```javascript web3.js
/* 
eth_getBlockReceipts is not available in Web3.js
Create a custom class using web3.extend to implement it
*/

const Web3 = require("web3");
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

web3.extend({
    property: 'eth',
    methods: [{
      name: 'getBlockReceipts',
      call: 'eth_getBlockReceipts',
      params: 1,
      inputFormatter: [web3.extend.formatters.inputDefaultBlockNumberFormatter],
      outputFormatter: null
    }]
  });

async function getBlockReceipts(blockId) {
  const receipts = await web3.eth.getBlockReceipts(blockId)
  console.log(receipts)
}
  
getBlockReceipts("latest")
```

```javascript ethers.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);

const eth_getBlockReceipts = async () => {
    const BlockReceipts = await provider.send("eth_getBlockReceipts", ["latest"]);
     console.log(BlockReceipts);
   };

eth_getBlockReceipts();
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3
node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL"
web3 = Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url)

block_receipts = web3.provider.make_request('eth_getBlockReceipts', ['latest'])
print(block_receipts)
```

## Use case

The `eth_getBlockReceipts` allows you to retrieve the receipts for all transactions in a specific block. A practical use case can be to retrieve all of the logs emitted from the transactions in a block. The method returns an array of transaction receipts, where each contains information about the transaction and any logs generated as a result of the transaction execution, so the logs can be isolated.

Here is an example of how to use `eth_getBlockReceipts` in ethers.js to extract all of the logs in a specific block and return them in an array:

```javascript index.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = 'CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL';
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);

async function retrieveTransactionLogs(blockNumber) {
  
    // Call the eth_getBlockReceipts method to retrieve the receipts for all transactions in the block
    let receipts = await provider.send('eth_getBlockReceipts', [blockNumber]);

    // Flatten the receipts array into a single array of logs
    let logs = receipts.flatMap(receipt => receipt.logs);

    // Return the logs
    return logs;
}

// call retrieveTransactionLogs on the latest block of the chain
async function main() {
     const blockNumber = 'latest';
    const logs = await retrieveTransactionLogs(blockNumber);
    console.log(logs);
}

main()
```


In this example, the `retrieveTransactionLogs` function takes a block identifier as an input and returns an array of logs. The function first calls the `eth_getBlockReceipts` method using the `provider.send` method and passes in the block identifier as an argument. The result is an array of receipts, then flattened into a single array of logs using the `flatMap` function.
