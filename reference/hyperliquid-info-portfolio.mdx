## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"portfolio"` to retrieve portfolio data.
* `user` (string, required) — Address in 42-character hexadecimal format; e.g. 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000.

## Response

The response is an array of portfolio performance data across different time periods. Each element is a tuple containing a time period identifier and the corresponding performance metrics.

### Response structure

The response contains portfolio data for the following time periods:

**Time period identifiers:**
- `"day"` — Daily portfolio performance (last 24 hours)
- `"week"` — Weekly portfolio performance (last 7 days)
- `"month"` — Monthly portfolio performance (last 30 days)
- `"allTime"` — All-time portfolio performance since account creation
- `"perpDay"` — Daily perpetual trading performance
- `"perpWeek"` — Weekly perpetual trading performance
- `"perpMonth"` — Monthly perpetual trading performance
- `"perpAllTime"` — All-time perpetual trading performance

### Performance metrics structure

Each time period contains the following performance data:

**Account value tracking:**
- `accountValueHistory` — Array of [timestamp, value] pairs showing account value progression over time
- Timestamps are in milliseconds since Unix epoch
- Values are represented as strings for precision

**Profit and loss tracking:**
- `pnlHistory` — Array of [timestamp, pnl] pairs showing profit/loss progression over time
- Timestamps are in milliseconds since Unix epoch
- PnL values are represented as strings for precision
- Shows cumulative realized and unrealized PnL

**Volume metrics:**
- `vlm` — Volume metric for the time period as a string
- Represents total trading volume during the period

### Data interpretation

**Account value history:**
- Shows the total account value at specific timestamps
- Includes both cash and position values
- Useful for tracking overall portfolio growth
- Data points are sampled at regular intervals

**PnL history:**
- Shows cumulative profit and loss at specific timestamps
- Includes both realized and unrealized PnL
- Positive values indicate profits, negative values indicate losses
- Tracks performance relative to initial account value

**Volume analysis:**
- Total trading volume for the specified period
- Helps assess trading activity levels
- Can be used to calculate volume-based metrics

## Portfolio analysis insights

### Performance evaluation

**Return analysis:**
- Compare account value at different time points to calculate returns
- Analyze PnL progression to understand profit/loss patterns
- Use different time periods to assess short-term vs long-term performance

**Risk assessment:**
- Examine account value volatility through historical data
- Analyze drawdown periods from PnL history
- Compare performance across different time horizons

**Activity analysis:**
- Volume metrics indicate trading frequency and size
- Compare volume across different periods to identify activity patterns
- Assess relationship between volume and performance

### Time period comparison

**Short-term performance:**
- Daily and weekly data for recent performance analysis
- Useful for tactical trading decisions
- Shows immediate impact of recent trades

**Long-term trends:**
- Monthly and all-time data for strategic analysis
- Helps identify long-term performance trends
- Useful for portfolio allocation decisions

**Perpetual vs spot trading:**
- Separate metrics for perpetual contract performance
- Enables analysis of different trading strategies
- Helps optimize trading approach by instrument type

### Historical data usage

**Trend identification:**
- Use historical data points to identify performance trends
- Analyze correlation between account value and market conditions
- Identify periods of outperformance or underperformance

**Performance attribution:**
- Compare PnL across different time periods
- Identify which periods contributed most to overall performance
- Analyze consistency of returns over time
