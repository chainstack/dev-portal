<CodeGroup>
```javascript ethers.js
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL");

async function getTransactionByIndex() {
  const blockHash = "0xf3cf930f1b4d9637134d09f126c57c30c3f4f40edf10ba502486b26d14b4f944";
  const index = "0x0"; // First transaction
  const tx = await provider.send("eth_getTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex", [blockHash, index]);
  console.log(tx);
}

getTransactionByIndex();
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3

node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL"

web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url))
block_hash = "0xf3cf930f1b4d9637134d09f126c57c30c3f4f40edf10ba502486b26d14b4f944"
tx = web3.eth.get_transaction_by_block(block_hash, 0)
print(tx)
```
