## Parameters

* `none`

## Response

* `result` â€” a string representing the filter ID. This ID should be used in subsequent calls to eth\_getFilterChanges to retrieve new pending transactions.

## Use case

The `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter` method is useful for applications that need to monitor the mempool for new transactions. Common use cases include:

* Building transaction monitoring tools
* Creating real-time transaction tracking interfaces
* Implementing MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) strategies
* Monitoring specific addresses for pending transactions

Note: After creating the filter, you need to poll `eth_getFilterChanges` periodically to get updates. Filters timeout if they're not used for a period of time, so applications should be prepared to recreate them if necessary.
