title: eth_getBlockReceipts | Monad
openapi: /openapi/monad_node_api/transaction_info/eth_getBlockReceipts.json POST /
---

Monad API method that returns all transaction receipts for a given block. This method is more efficient than calling `eth_getTransactionReceipt` for each transaction individually when you need all receipts from a block.

## Parameters

* `quantity|tag` — the block number as a hexadecimal string, or one of the following block tags:
  * `latest` — the most recent block in the canonical chain
  * `earliest` — the genesis block
  * `pending` — the pending state/transactions

## Response

* `result` — an array of transaction receipt objects, each containing:
  * `transactionHash` — hash of the transaction
  * `transactionIndex` — index position of the transaction
  * `blockHash` — hash of the block containing this transaction
  * `blockNumber` — number of the block containing this transaction
  * `from` — address of the sender
  * `to` — address of the receiver
  * `cumulativeGasUsed` — total gas used in the block up to this transaction
  * `gasUsed` — gas used by this transaction
  * `contractAddress` — contract address created, if any
  * `logs` — array of log objects generated by this transaction
  * `logsBloom` — bloom filter for the logs
  * `status` — `1` (success) or `0` (failure)

## `eth_getBlockReceipts` code examples

<CodeGroup>
```javascript ethers.js
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL");

async function getBlockReceipts() {
  const blockNumber = "latest"; // Or use hex like "0x1234"
  const receipts = await provider.send("eth_getBlockReceipts", [blockNumber]);
  console.log(`Found ${receipts.length} receipts`);
  receipts.forEach((receipt, i) => {
    console.log(`Transaction ${i}: ${receipt.transactionHash}, Gas used: ${parseInt(receipt.gasUsed, 16)}`);
  });
}

getBlockReceipts();
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3

node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL"

web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url))

# Using raw RPC call
receipts = web3.provider.make_request('eth_getBlockReceipts', ['latest'])
for receipt in receipts['result']:
    print(f"Transaction: {receipt['transactionHash']}, Gas used: {int(receipt['gasUsed'], 16)}")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Use case

A practical use case for `eth_getBlockReceipts` is building analytics tools that need to process all transaction outcomes in a block, such as calculating total gas usage, counting successful vs. failed transactions, or extracting all events emitted in a block.
