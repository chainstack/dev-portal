## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"l2Book"` to retrieve order book snapshot.
* `coin` (string, required) — Asset identifier (simple names like "BTC", "ETH" for perpetuals; spot format like "@107" for spot trades).
* `nSigFigs` (integer, optional) — Optional field to aggregate levels to `nSigFigs` significant figures. Valid values are 2, 3, 4, 5, and `null` (full precision).
* `mantissa` (integer, optional) — Optional field to aggregate levels. This field is only allowed if nSigFigs is 5. Accepts values of 1, 2 or 5.

## Response

The response is an array containing exactly two arrays representing the order book sides:

### Response structure

**Array format:** `[bids, asks]`
- **First array (index 0):** Bid levels (buy orders) sorted by price descending
- **Second array (index 1):** Ask levels (sell orders) sorted by price ascending

### Level data structure

Each price level contains the following fields:

**Core level data:**
- `px` — Price level as a string for precision
- `sz` — Total size (quantity) at this price level as a string
- `n` — The number of different orders that comprise this level

### Data limits and ordering

**Response limits:**
- Maximum 20 levels per side (bids and asks)
- Bids are sorted by price in descending order (highest to lowest)
- Asks are sorted by price in ascending order (lowest to highest)

**Price precision:**
- All prices and sizes are returned as strings to maintain precision
- Actual precision depends on the asset's tick size

### Price aggregation options

**Significant figures (`nSigFigs`):**
- `2` — Aggregate to 2 significant figures (e.g., 12000, 1200)
- `3` — Aggregate to 3 significant figures (e.g., 12300, 1230)
- `4` — Aggregate to 4 significant figures (e.g., 12340, 1234)
- `5` — Aggregate to 5 significant figures (e.g., 12345, 1234.5)
- `null` — Full precision (no aggregation)

**Mantissa (only when `nSigFigs` is 5):**
- `1` — Round to nearest 1 (e.g., 12345)
- `2` — Round to nearest 2 (e.g., 12344, 12346)
- `5` — Round to nearest 5 (e.g., 12345, 12350)

### Asset identification

**Perpetual contracts:**
- Use simple asset names: "BTC", "ETH", "AVAX", "SOL"
- Represent standard perpetual futures contracts

**Spot markets:**
- Use indexed format: "@107", "@1", etc.
- Index corresponds to the spot pair position in the universe
- Some assets may have remapped names in user interfaces

## Order book interpretation

### Understanding the data

**Bid side (buyers):**
- Shows prices where buyers are willing to purchase
- Higher prices indicate stronger buying interest
- Sorted from highest price to lowest price

**Ask side (sellers):**
- Shows prices where sellers are willing to sell
- Lower prices indicate more competitive selling
- Sorted from lowest price to highest price

**Spread calculation:**
- Spread = Lowest ask price - Highest bid price
- Tighter spreads indicate more liquid markets

### Order count significance

**Order count (`n` field):**
- Indicates market depth and liquidity at each level
- Higher counts suggest more distributed interest
- Single large orders vs. many small orders provide different market signals
