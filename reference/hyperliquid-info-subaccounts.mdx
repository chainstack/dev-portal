### Understanding sub-accounts

**Sub-account benefits:**
- **Portfolio segregation**: Separate trading strategies or asset classes
- **Risk isolation**: Limit exposure by isolating positions across accounts
- **Strategy organization**: Dedicated accounts for different trading approaches
- **Performance tracking**: Monitor results of specific strategies independently

**Account hierarchy:**
- **Master account**: Primary account with overall control and access
- **Sub-accounts**: Secondary accounts managed under the master account
- **Unified management**: Master account can oversee all sub-account activities

**Use cases:**
- **Multi-strategy trading**: Different accounts for different trading strategies
- **Risk management**: Isolate high-risk trades from conservative positions
- **Team management**: Separate accounts for different team members or roles
- **Asset segregation**: Dedicated accounts for specific asset classes
