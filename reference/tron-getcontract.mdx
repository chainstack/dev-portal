## Parameters

* `value` — the smart contract address in hexadecimal format

## Response

* `bytecode` — compiled contract bytecode in hexadecimal format
* `name` — human-readable name of the smart contract
* `origin_address` — address of the account that deployed the contract
* `contract_address` — the contract's address in hexadecimal format
* `abi` — Application Binary Interface defining contract methods and events
* `origin_energy_limit` — maximum energy limit set during contract deployment
* `consume_user_resource_percent` — percentage of caller's resources used for contract execution (0-100)
* `code_hash` — unique hash identifier of the contract's bytecode
* `trx_hash` — transaction hash of the original contract deployment transaction

## Use case

The `wallet/getcontract` method is used for:

* Retrieving comprehensive information about deployed smart contracts.
* Obtaining contract ABI for building user interfaces and interaction tools.
* Analyzing contract resource configuration and deployment details.
* Verifying contract bytecode and comparing with expected implementations.
* Building block explorers and contract verification tools.
* Understanding contract resource consumption settings for optimization.
