description: "This page provides an overview of the available methods on Chainstack Bitcoin nodes using the Bitcoin RPC API. The methods are divided into three categories:"
---

* Immediately accessible methods
* Methods requiring further customization
* Unavailable methods on Chainstack Bitcoin nodes

This guide will help you better understand and utilize the capabilities of Chainstack Bitcoin nodes within the context of the Bitcoin RPC API.

## Chainstack Bitcoin API table

The table features an **Availability** column, which outlines the method's accessibility on a Bitcoin node deployed via Chainstack. The availability is classified into three levels:

* **Available** — the corresponding method is immediately accessible upon deploying a Chainstack Elastic Bitcoin node.
* **Customization required** — the corresponding method can be enabled on a dedicated Chainstack Bitcoin node with additional customization.
* **Not available** — the corresponding method **cannot** be activated on any Chainstack Bitcoin node.

This classification assists users in understanding the availability of each method within Chainstack Bitcoin nodes.

<Info>
  Easlily interact with the Bitcoin API using the [Bitcoin API Postman collection](/api-reference/bitcoin-rpc-methods-postman-collection).

## Dedicated Bitcoin nodes

In case you need access to methods requiring customization, you can request a dedicated node directly from the Chainstack console UI, and a Chainstack Support representative will contact you shortly.

### Blockchain RPC methods

Blockchain RPC methods allow developers to interact with and gather information about the Bitcoin blockchain, such as querying transactions and network data.
