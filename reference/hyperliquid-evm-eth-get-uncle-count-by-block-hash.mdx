## Parameters

* `blockHash` (string, required) — The 32-byte hash of the block

## Returns

Returns the number of uncle blocks as a hex-encoded integer, or `null` if the block is not found.

<Note>
On Hyperliquid, uncle blocks are not part of the consensus mechanism. This method is included for Ethereum compatibility but will typically return "0x0" as Hyperliquid doesn't produce uncle blocks.
