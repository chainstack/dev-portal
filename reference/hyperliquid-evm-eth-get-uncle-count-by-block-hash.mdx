<Info>
This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available on Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support them yet — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

Returns the number of uncle blocks for a given block hash. Use this method to get the count of uncle (ommer) blocks associated with a specific block.

## Parameters

* `blockHash` (string, required) — The 32-byte hash of the block

## Returns

Returns the number of uncle blocks as a hex-encoded integer, or `null` if the block is not found.

<Note>
On Hyperliquid, uncle blocks are not part of the consensus mechanism. This method is included for Ethereum compatibility but will typically return "0x0" as Hyperliquid doesn't produce uncle blocks.
</Note>

## Use cases

* **Ethereum compatibility** — Maintain compatibility with Ethereum RPC interfaces
* **Block analysis tools** — Complete block metadata collection
* **Network statistics** — Gather comprehensive blockchain metrics
* **Protocol research** — Study consensus mechanisms and block production
* **Migration tools** — Ensure compatibility when porting Ethereum applications
* **Testing frameworks** — Validate RPC method implementations
