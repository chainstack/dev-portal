<Info>
This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `eth_getBlockReceipts` JSON-RPC method returns all transaction receipts for a given block. This method is highly efficient for retrieving receipt data for all transactions in a block with a single API call, making it ideal for block processing, event extraction, and comprehensive transaction analysis.

## Parameters

The method takes one parameter:

1. **Block number** - The block for which to retrieve all transaction receipts

### Parameter details

* `blockNumber` (string, required) — Block identifier: `"latest"`, `"earliest"`, `"pending"`, or a specific block number in hexadecimal

## Response

The method returns an array of transaction receipt objects for all transactions in the specified block.

### Response structure

**Receipt array:**
- Array of transaction receipt objects, one for each transaction in the block
- Empty array if the block contains no transactions
- `null` if the block doesn't exist

**Transaction receipt object:**
- `transactionHash` — Hash of the transaction
- `transactionIndex` — Index of the transaction in the block (0-based)
- `blockHash` — Hash of the block containing the transaction
- `blockNumber` — Number of the block containing the transaction
- `from` — Address of the transaction sender
- `to` — Address of the transaction receiver (null for contract creation)
- `gasUsed` — Amount of gas used by this specific transaction
- `cumulativeGasUsed` — Total gas used in the block up to and including this transaction
- `contractAddress` — Address of the created contract (null if not a contract creation)
- `logs` — Array of log objects generated by the transaction
- `status` — Transaction status (`0x0` for failure, `0x1` for success)
- `effectiveGasPrice` — Actual gas price paid by the transaction
- `type` — Transaction type (0x0 for legacy, 0x1 for EIP-2930, 0x2 for EIP-1559)

## Usage example

### Basic implementation

```javascript
// Get all transaction receipts for a block on Hyperliquid
const getBlockReceipts = async (blockNumber) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/YOUR_ENDPOINT/evm', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      method: 'eth_getBlockReceipts',
      params: [blockNumber],
      id: 1
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.result;
};

// Analyze block transaction outcomes
const analyzeBlockTransactions = async (blockNumber) => {
  const receipts = await getBlockReceipts(blockNumber);
  
  if (!receipts || receipts.length === 0) {
    return { message: 'No transactions in block' };
  }
  
  const analysis = {
    totalTransactions: receipts.length,
    successfulTransactions: 0,
    failedTransactions: 0,
    totalGasUsed: 0,
    contractCreations: 0,
    totalLogs: 0
  };
  
  receipts.forEach(receipt => {
    // Count successful vs failed transactions
    if (receipt.status === '0x1') {
      analysis.successfulTransactions++;
    } else {
      analysis.failedTransactions++;
    }
    
    // Sum gas usage
    analysis.totalGasUsed += parseInt(receipt.gasUsed, 16);
    
    // Count contract creations
    if (receipt.contractAddress) {
      analysis.contractCreations++;
    }
    
    // Count logs/events
    analysis.totalLogs += receipt.logs.length;
  });
  
  analysis.successRate = (analysis.successfulTransactions / analysis.totalTransactions) * 100;
  
  return analysis;
};

// Extract all events from a block
const extractBlockEvents = async (blockNumber, contractAddress = null) => {
  const receipts = await getBlockReceipts(blockNumber);
  
  if (!receipts) {
    return [];
  }
  
  // Extract all logs from all receipts
  const allLogs = receipts.flatMap(receipt => 
    receipt.logs.map(log => ({
      ...log,
      transactionHash: receipt.transactionHash,
      transactionIndex: receipt.transactionIndex,
      blockNumber: receipt.blockNumber
    }))
  );
  
  // Filter by contract address if specified
  if (contractAddress) {
    return allLogs.filter(log => 
      log.address.toLowerCase() === contractAddress.toLowerCase()
    );
  }
  
  return allLogs;
};

// Usage examples
analyzeBlockTransactions('latest')
  .then(analysis => console.log('Block Analysis:', analysis))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

// Extract events from a specific block
extractBlockEvents('0x9d0c37')
  .then(events => console.log(`Found ${events.length} events in block`))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

## Hyperliquid-specific considerations

### System transactions

**HyperCore transactions:**
- Block receipts include receipts for both regular and system transactions
- System transactions originate from HyperCore and may have different patterns
- All transactions (regular and system) are included in the receipt array
- System transactions contribute to block gas usage and event generation

### Efficiency benefits

**Batch processing:**
- Retrieve all receipts for a block in one request
- More efficient than individual `eth_getTransactionReceipt` calls
- Reduces API call overhead and network latency
- Ideal for processing entire blocks atomically

### Receipt data interpretation

**Transaction status:**
- `0x1` — Transaction succeeded
- `0x0` — Transaction failed (reverted)
- Failed transactions still consume gas
- Check status before processing transaction effects

**Gas analysis:**
- `gasUsed` — Gas consumed by individual transaction
- `cumulativeGasUsed` — Total gas used up to this transaction in the block
- Use for calculating gas efficiency and block utilization

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockReceipts","params":["0x9d0c37"],"id":1}' \
  https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/4f8d8f4040bdacd1577bff8058438274/evm
```

## Use cases

The `eth_getBlockReceipts` method is essential for applications that need to:

* **Block processing**: Efficiently process all transactions in a block with a single API call
* **Event indexing**: Build comprehensive event indexes from receipt data
* **Analytics platforms**: Collect transaction and event data for analysis
* **DeFi monitoring**: Track protocol events and state changes
* **Audit systems**: Verify transaction outcomes and contract interactions
* **Block explorers**: Display comprehensive block transaction information
* **Transaction monitoring**: Track transaction success rates and patterns
* **Gas analysis**: Analyze gas usage patterns across block transactions
* **Smart contract monitoring**: Track contract interactions and events
* **System transaction analysis**: Analyze both regular and HyperCore system transaction receipts
* **Data synchronization**: Maintain synchronized blockchain data
* **Integration services**: Provide receipt data to external systems

<Note>
This method returns receipts for all transactions in a block, including both regular transactions and system transactions from HyperCore. This can be a large amount of data for blocks with many transactions. Consider filtering strategies for high-volume blocks.
