**TON pricing is the same for full, archive, v2, v3**

There's no difference between a full node an archive node in data availability or pricing.
All data is always available and all node requests are consumed as 1 request unit.

## Parameters

* `account_address` (string, optional) — Account address to query.
* `include_boc` (boolean, optional) — Include code and data BoC in response. Default: `false`.
* `limit` (integer, optional) — Maximum number of states to return. Default: `10`.
* `offset` (integer, optional) — Number of states to skip for pagination. Default: `0`.
* `sort` (string, optional) — Sort order: `asc` or `desc`. Default: `desc`.

## Response

* `account_states` (array) — Array of account state objects:
  * `account` (string) — Account address.
  * `hash` (string) — State hash.
  * `balance` (string) — Account balance in nanotons.
  * `account_status` (string) — Account status (`active`, `uninit`, `frozen`).
  * `last_trans_lt` (integer) — Logical time of last transaction.
  * `last_trans_hash` (string) — Hash of last transaction.
  * `frozen_hash` (string) — Hash if account is frozen.
  * `code_hash` (string) — Hash of the code cell.
  * `data_hash` (string) — Hash of the data cell.
  * `code_boc` (string) — Code BoC (if `include_boc` is true).
  * `data_boc` (string) — Data BoC (if `include_boc` is true).

* `address_book` (object) — Address book mapping.

## Use case

The `accountStates` endpoint is useful for applications that need detailed account information:

1. Block explorers displaying account history and state changes.
2. Smart contract analysis tools examining code and data.
3. Wallet applications showing detailed account information.
4. Auditing tools tracking account state over time.
5. Research applications studying account behavior patterns.

Here's an example of querying account state:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  curl -X GET \
    'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v3/accountStates?account_address=EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs&include_boc=true&limit=1' \
    -H 'accept: application/json'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Set `include_boc` to `true` only when you need the actual code and data cells, as this significantly increases response size.
