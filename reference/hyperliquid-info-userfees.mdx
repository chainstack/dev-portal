### Understanding fee structure

**Cross vs Add (Isolated) margin:**
- **Cross margin**: Uses entire account balance as collateral for positions
- **Add/Isolated margin**: Each position has dedicated collateral
- **Cross rates**: Generally higher due to increased risk sharing
- **Add rates**: Lower rates to encourage isolated position management

**Fee types:**
- **Perpetuals fees**: `userCrossRate` and `userAddRate` for perpetual futures
- **Spot fees**: `userSpotCrossRate` and `userSpotAddRate` for spot trading
- **Market maker rebates**: Negative fees for qualifying market makers

**Discount mechanisms:**
- **Referral discounts**: Reductions based on referral program participation
- **Staking discounts**: Fee reductions based on token staking amounts
- **VIP tiers**: Volume-based fee reductions with specific cutoffs
- **Trial programs**: Temporary fee benefits and rewards

**Rate calculation:**
- Base rates are modified by applicable discounts
- User-specific rates show final effective rates after all benefits
- Staking discounts based on percentage of maximum token supply held
