## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"maxMarketOrderNtls"` to retrieve maximum market order limits.

## Response

The response is an array of objects containing market order limits for each asset:

### Market order limit fields

* `coin` (string) — Asset symbol (e.g., "BTC", "ETH", "SOL", "AVAX")
* `maxNtl` (string) — Maximum notional value allowed for market orders in USD
* `maxSz` (string, optional) — Maximum size allowed for market orders in asset units

### Understanding market order limits

**Notional value limits:**
- Expressed in USD regardless of the asset being traded
- Prevents single orders from causing excessive market impact
- Varies by asset based on liquidity and volatility characteristics

**Size limits:**
- Expressed in native asset units (e.g., BTC, ETH)
- May not be present for all assets
- Provides alternative sizing constraint alongside notional limits

**Risk management:**
- Limits protect both traders and the exchange from extreme market movements
- Larger, more liquid assets typically have higher limits
- Limits may be adjusted dynamically based on market conditions
