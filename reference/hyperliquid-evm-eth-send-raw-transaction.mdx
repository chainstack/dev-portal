<Info>
This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available on Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support them yet — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `eth_sendRawTransaction` JSON-RPC method submits a pre-signed transaction to the network for broadcasting and inclusion in a block. This method is essential for sending transactions that have been signed offline or by external wallets, enabling secure transaction submission without exposing private keys.

## Parameters

The method takes one parameter:

1. **Signed transaction data** — The signed raw transaction data

### Parameter details

* `signedTransactionData` (string, required) — The signed transaction data in hexadecimal format with `0x` prefix

## Response

The method returns the transaction hash if the transaction was successfully submitted to the network.

### Response structure

**Transaction hash:**
- `result` — The 32-byte transaction hash as a hexadecimal string

### Transaction status

**Submission outcomes:**
- Success returns a transaction hash immediately
- The hash does not guarantee inclusion in a block
- Use `eth_getTransactionReceipt` to confirm inclusion
- Failed transactions may still consume gas

**Common errors:**
- `nonce too low` — Transaction nonce already used
- `insufficient funds` — Account lacks funds for gas + value
- `gas limit exceeded` — Transaction gas limit too high
- `transaction underpriced` — Gas price below network minimum

## Hyperliquid-specific considerations

### Transaction requirements

**Gas and fees:**
- Transactions require HYPE for gas fees
- Gas prices fluctuate based on network demand
- Use `eth_gasPrice` to get current gas price
- Consider priority fees for faster inclusion

### Transaction monitoring

**Confirmation tracking:**
- Monitor transaction status with `eth_getTransactionReceipt`
- Check for transaction replacement by monitoring nonce
- Verify block confirmations for finality
- Handle reorg scenarios appropriately

## Use cases

The `eth_sendRawTransaction` method is essential for applications that need to:

* **Wallet applications**: Submit user-signed transactions to the network
* **DeFi protocols**: Execute pre-signed transactions for swaps and liquidity operations
* **Trading bots**: Submit high-frequency trading transactions
* **Bridge operations**: Process cross-chain transfer transactions
* **Smart contract interactions**: Deploy contracts and execute contract methods
* **Batch operations**: Submit multiple pre-signed transactions sequentially
* **Multisig wallets**: Submit transactions signed by multiple parties
* **Hardware wallets**: Broadcast transactions signed offline
* **Payment systems**: Process payment transactions securely
* **Token transfers**: Send ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 token transfers
* **Staking operations**: Submit staking and delegation transactions
* **Governance voting**: Cast votes in on-chain governance systems
* **NFT minting**: Submit minting transactions for NFT collections
* **Liquidation bots**: Execute time-sensitive liquidation transactions
* **Arbitrage systems**: Submit profitable arbitrage transactions quickly
* **Meta-transactions**: Process gasless transactions via relayers
* **Scheduled transactions**: Submit pre-signed future transactions
* **Recovery operations**: Broadcast recovery transactions for compromised accounts
* **Testing frameworks**: Submit test transactions in development environments
* **Analytics tools**: Monitor transaction submission patterns
* **Security systems**: Submit security-related transactions like pausing contracts
* **Compliance tools**: Process regulatory-required transactions
* **Integration services**: Bridge web2 and web3 transaction systems
* **Mobile applications**: Submit transactions from mobile wallets
* **Game transactions**: Process in-game asset transfers and purchases

This method provides the fundamental capability to submit transactions to the Hyperliquid EVM network, enabling all transaction-based operations on the platform.

<Note>
Ensure your transaction is properly signed and includes the correct nonce, gas price, and gas limit before submission. Failed transactions will still consume gas fees. Always verify the transaction hash returned and monitor its status using `eth_getTransactionReceipt`.
