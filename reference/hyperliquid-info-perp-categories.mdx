<Info>
This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available on Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support them yet — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `info` endpoint with `type: "perpCategories"` retrieves all HIP-3 perpetual assets that have a category set via `setPerpAnnotation`. Returns an array of `[coin, category]` tuples, or an empty array if no deployers have set categories.

## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"perpCategories"`.

## Response

An array of two-element arrays, where each entry contains:

* Index 0 (string) — HIP-3 asset symbol in `deployer:TICKER` format.
* Index 1 (string) — Category label assigned by the deployer.

Returns an empty array if no deployers have set categories. Only HIP-3 deployed assets appear — native Hyperliquid perps (BTC, ETH, etc.) are never included.

The official Hyperliquid UI only displays categories from a predefined set in lowercase with no special characters (e.g., `"indices"`, `"commodities"`, `"ai"`, `"meme"`, `"defi"`, `"gaming"`, `"layer1"`, `"layer2"`, `"stocks"`, `"forex"`).

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "perpCategories"}' \
  https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/4f8d8f4040bdacd1577bff8058438274/info
```

## Example response

When categories exist:

```json
[
  ["xyz:GOLD", "commodities"],
  ["xyz:SPX", "indices"],
  ["abc:AGENT", "ai"]
]
```

When no deployers have set categories:

```json
[]
```

## Use case

The `info` endpoint with `type: "perpCategories"` is useful for:

* Organizing HIP-3 perpetual assets into categories for trading interfaces
* Building category-based navigation and filtering for asset discovery
* Displaying a categorized catalog of deployer-created perpetual contracts
