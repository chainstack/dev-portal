## Parameters

* `address` — the address of the account.
* `storageKeys` — an array of storage keys to prove.
* `block` — the block number (in hexadecimal) or one of the strings `"earliest"`, `"latest"`, or `"pending"`, indicating the state to consider. The default is `"latest"`.

## Response

* `result` — an object containing the account proof, balance, code hash, nonce, storage hash, and storage proof for each requested storage key.

## Use case

The `eth_getProof` method is essential for:

* Applications that need to verify account or contract state without syncing the entire blockchain.
* Services that provide cryptographic proofs of specific data to third parties.
* Tools that audit the state of accounts or contracts at specific block heights.
