title: eth_uninstallFilter | Optimism
openapi: /openapi/optimism_node_api/eth_uninstallFilter.json POST /efb0a5eccd2caa5135eb54eba6f7f300
---

Optimism API method `eth_uninstallFilter` removes a previously installed filter, stopping further notifications. This method is crucial for managing resources and avoiding unnecessary data processing from filters that are no longer needed.

<Warning>
**Disclaimer**

Note that the default interactive example in this page will not work as the filter will be expired.

To test `eth_uninstallFilter` in this page, first create a new filter using one of the following:

* [eth\_newFilter | Optimism](/reference/polygon_node_api/logs_and_events/eth_newFilter)
* [eth\_newBlockFilter | Optimism](/reference/optimism_node_api/eth_newBlockFilter)

Then use the fresh filter ID as the parameter for `eth_uninstallFilter`.

## Parameters

* `filterId` — the ID of the filter to be uninstalled. This ID is returned by filter creation methods such as `eth_newBlockFilter`, or `eth_newFilter`. For this example, a random value `"0x1a2b3c"` is used.

## Response

* `result` — a boolean indicating the success of the filter removal. `true` if the filter was successfully uninstalled; otherwise, `false`.

## Use case

The `eth_uninstallFilter` method is essential for:

* Applications that dynamically create and remove filters based on user interaction or specific conditions to manage system resources efficiently.
* Services that need to clean up filters to prevent processing outdated or irrelevant data.
* Developers who are testing or debugging Optimism filters and need to reset their filter setup.
