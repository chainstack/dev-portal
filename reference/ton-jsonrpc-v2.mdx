<Note>
**TON pricing is the same for full, archive, v2, v3**

There's no difference between a full node an archive node in data availability or pricing.  
All data is always available and all node requests are consumed as 1 request unit.

## Parameters

* `jsonrpc` (string, required) — The JSON-RPC version, must be "2.0".
* `method` (string, required) — The name of the method to execute.
* `params` (object, optional) — A dictionary of parameters for the method.
* `id` (string/integer, required) — A unique identifier for the request.

## Use case

The `jsonRPC` endpoint is the primary gateway for applications that prefer a standard RPC interface over REST. It supports all available methods in the API and is commonly used by:

1.  **Wallets and dApps:** To query account state, send transactions, and estimate fees.
2.  **SDKs and Libraries:** As the underlying transport layer for higher-level abstractions.
3.  **Integrations:** For systems that require a uniform interface for multiple blockchain interactions.
