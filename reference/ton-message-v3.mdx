# Send Message

The `message` endpoint sends an external message to the TON network. This is the v3 API method for submitting signed transactions to the blockchain.

<Note>
**TON pricing is the same for full, archive, v2, v3**

There's no difference between a full node an archive node in data availability or pricing.
All data is always available and all node requests are consumed as 1 request unit.

## Parameters

* `boc` (string, required) — The serialized bag-of-cells in base64 format containing the signed external message.

## Response

* `message_hash` (string) — The hash of the sent message, which can be used to track the transaction.

## Use case

The `message` endpoint is essential for any application that needs to send transactions via the v3 API:

1. Wallet applications broadcasting user-signed transactions.
2. Smart contract deployment and interaction.
3. DApps submitting user transactions to the network.
4. Automated systems executing on-chain operations.
5. Token transfer services sending Jetton or NFT transfers.

Here's an example of sending a transaction:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  curl -X POST \
    'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v3/message' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "boc": "te6ccgEBAgEAqwAB4YgBVbC7Hu+g3htYXzst8L5ucV76NMzeBK3URJKebN2Y1kwADRfFu/r0HxgrOp/Iml8Li5x4gR10J5XYFS8z0fMWJ6JPeUF5xNSLrSDGFIqhJqkW1SEYQF8Dw5p4dI3oaFs4LCmpoxdkfKw0AAAAGAAcAQBoQgAwwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL68="
  }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Use the returned `message_hash` with the [transactions](/reference/ton-transactions-v3) or [traces](/reference/ton-traces-v3) endpoints to track transaction status and execution results.
