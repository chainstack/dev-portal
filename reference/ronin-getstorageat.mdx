This example makes a call to slot 0 of the [USDC contract](https://app.roninchain.com/address/0x0b7007c13325c48911f73a2dad5fa5dcbf808adc) on the Ronin Mainnet.

The `eth_getStorageAt` method returns the value stored at a specific position of the storage of a given address, expressed in hexadecimal. This method is useful for inspecting the state of smart contracts at specific storage slots.

## Parameters

* `address`: The address to get the storage from. For example, `0x0b7007c13325c48911f73a2dad5fa5dcbf808adc`.
* `position`: The storage position to inspect, given as a hexadecimal value. For example, `0x0` for the first position.
* `blockParameter` (optional): This can be a hexadecimal block number, or the strings "latest", "earliest", or "pending", indicating the state from which to get the storage value. The default is `latest`.

## Response

* `result`: The value at the specified storage position, returned as a hexadecimal string.

## Use case

This method is particularly useful for developers and auditors who need to verify the state of a smart contract's storage directly on the blockchain. It allows for detailed inspection of contract state and can be used to debug or verify contract behavior.
