<Info>
This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `ots_hasCode` JSON-RPC method checks whether a specified address contains deployed contract code on the Hyperliquid EVM blockchain. This Otterscan-specific method provides a quick way to determine if an address is a smart contract or an externally owned account (EOA).

## Parameters

1. **address** (string, required): The address to check for deployed code
2. **block identifier** (string, optional): The block at which to check the code
   - Can be a block number, block hash, or one of: `"earliest"`, `"latest"`, `"pending"`
   - Defaults to `"latest"`

## Response

The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the address contains code.

### Response structure

- `true` — the address contains deployed contract code
- `false` — the address is an EOA or does not exist

## Usage example

```shell Shell
curl -X POST https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/4f8d8f4040bdacd1577bff8058438274/evm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "ots_hasCode",
    "params": ["0x5555555555555555555555555555555555555555", "latest"],
    "id": 1
  }'
```

### Example response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": true
}
```

### Check at specific block

```shell Shell
curl -X POST https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/4f8d8f4040bdacd1577bff8058438274/evm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "ots_hasCode",
    "params": ["0x5555555555555555555555555555555555555555", "0x1000"],
    "id": 1
  }'
```

## Use cases

The `ots_hasCode` method is essential for:

* **Address classification**: Quickly determine if an address is a contract or EOA
* **Transaction validation**: Check if transaction targets are contracts before sending
* **Security checks**: Verify addresses before interacting with them
* **UI differentiation**: Display different interfaces for contracts vs EOAs
* **Gas estimation**: Optimize gas estimates based on target address type
* **Contract verification**: Confirm successful contract deployment
* **Historical analysis**: Check when contracts were deployed by testing different blocks
* **Wallet integration**: Warn users when sending to contracts vs regular addresses
* **Smart contract interaction**: Pre-validate addresses before calling contract methods
* **Block explorer optimization**: Efficiently categorize addresses without fetching full code

This method provides a lightweight alternative to `eth_getCode` when you only need to know if code exists, not the actual bytecode itself.
