**TON pricing is the same for full, archive, v2, v3**

There's no difference between a full node an archive node in data availability or pricing.  
All data is always available and all node requests are consumed as 1 request unit.

## JSON-RPC examples

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v2/jsonRPC' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getShardBlockProof",
    "params": {
      "workchain": -1,
      "shard": "-9223372036854775808",
      "seqno": 39064874
    }
  }'
```


## Parameters

* `workchain` (integer, required) — The ID of the workchain. Example: `-1` for the masterchain.
* `shard` (integer, required) — The ID of the shard. Example: `-9223372036854775808` for the masterchain.
* `seqno` (integer, required) — The sequence number of the block. Example: `39064874`.

## Response

* `masterchain_block_root_hash` (string) — The root hash of the masterchain block that includes this shard block.
* `masterchain_block_seq_no` (integer) — The sequence number of the masterchain block.
* `links` (array of objects) — An array of link objects, each containing:
  + `from` (string) — The source block hash.
  + `to` (string) — The destination block hash.
  + `dest_proof` (string) — The proof of the destination block.
  + `proof` (string) — The proof of the link.
* `block_header` (string) — The header of the shard block.

## Use case

A possible use case for the `getShardBlockProof` method in TON is for applications or services that need to verify the authenticity and inclusion of shard blocks within the TON blockchain. This method can be used to:

1. Implement light clients that can verify shard blocks without downloading the entire blockchain.
2. Provide cryptographic proof of a shard block's inclusion in the blockchain.
3. Verify cross-shard transactions by proving the existence of blocks in different shards.
4. Build block explorers that can show detailed proof information for each block.
