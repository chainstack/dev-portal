Ronin API method that creates a new filter in the node. This filter allows applications to receive notifications when new blocks are added to the blockchain. Once the filter is created, the application can periodically use `eth_getFilterChanges` to get an array of block hashes of the latest blocks.

## Parameters

* `none` — This method does not require any parameters.

## Response

* `result` — the filter identifier (`filterId`) as a hexadecimal string. This ID is used to query the filter changes or to uninstall the filter.

## Use case

The `eth_newBlockFilter` method is particularly useful for applications that need to stay synchronized with the latest state of the blockchain, such as wallets, block explorers, or decentralized applications (DApps) that react to new blocks. It provides a more efficient way to monitor the blockchain for new blocks compared to polling the latest block number.
