## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"userVaultEquities"` to retrieve user's vault equity positions.
* `user` (string, required) — Address in 42-character hexadecimal format (e.g., `0x2b804617c6f63c040377e95bb276811747006f4b`).

## Response

The response is an array of vault equity objects representing each vault investment:

### Response structure

Each vault equity object contains:

* `vaultAddress` (string) — Contract address of the vault (42-character hexadecimal)
* `equity` (string) — Current total equity value of the user's position in USD

### Understanding vault equity

**Equity value:**
- Represents the current total value of the user's investment in the vault
- Reflects real-time value based on vault performance and share pricing
- Calculated internally by the vault based on the user's share ownership

**Investment tracking:**
- Each vault investment is tracked separately by vault address
- Equity values change based on vault performance and market conditions
- Values are denominated in USD for easy comparison and analysis

**Vault identification:**
- Vault addresses uniquely identify each vault investment
- Can be used with other endpoints (like `vaultDetails`) to get additional vault information
- Allows tracking of investments across multiple vault positions
