## Parameters

* `multisig_address` (string, optional) — Filter by multisig wallet address.
* `order_address` (string, optional) — Filter by specific order contract address.
* `is_executed` (boolean, optional) — Filter by execution status.
* `limit` (integer, optional) — Maximum number of orders to return. Default: `10`.
* `offset` (integer, optional) — Number of orders to skip for pagination. Default: `0`.

## Response

* `multisig_orders` (array) — Array of order objects:
  * `address` (string) — Order contract address.
  * `multisig_address` (string) — Parent multisig wallet address.
  * `order_seqno` (integer) — Order sequence number.
  * `threshold` (integer) — Required number of signatures.
  * `signers_num` (integer) — Total number of possible signers.
  * `approvals_num` (integer) — Current number of approvals.
  * `approvals` (array) — List of addresses that have approved.
  * `expiration_date` (integer) — Order expiration timestamp.
  * `is_executed` (boolean) — Whether the order has been executed.

* `address_book` (object) — Address book mapping.

## Use case

The `multisig/orders` endpoint is crucial for multisig transaction management:

1. Signer interfaces showing orders awaiting their approval.
2. Treasury dashboards displaying pending transactions.
3. Alert systems notifying when orders need signatures.
4. Audit tools tracking multisig transaction history.
5. Governance tools managing DAO proposals and executions.

Here's an example of getting pending orders for a multisig wallet:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  curl -X GET \
    'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v3/multisig/orders?is_executed=false&limit=5' \
    -H 'accept: application/json'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Monitor `expiration_date` to ensure orders are signed before they expire. Orders that expire without enough signatures will need to be recreated.
