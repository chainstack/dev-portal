## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"fundingHistory"` to retrieve funding rate history.
* `coin` (string, required) — Asset symbol to retrieve funding history for (e.g., "BTC", "ETH", "SOL").
* `startTime` (integer, required) — Start timestamp in milliseconds, inclusive. Filters funding history from this time forward.
* `endTime` (integer, optional) — End timestamp in milliseconds, inclusive. Defaults to current time if not provided.

## Response

The response is an array of funding rate records, chronologically ordered from oldest to newest. Each record represents a funding rate snapshot taken at regular intervals (typically every 8 hours for most exchanges).

### Response structure

Each funding rate record contains:

**Asset identification:**
- `coin` — Asset symbol (e.g., "BTC", "ETH", "SOL")

**Funding metrics:**
- `fundingRate` — The funding rate applied to positions (decimal format)
- `premium` — Market premium component used in funding calculation
- `time` — Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the rate was applied

### Data interpretation

**Funding rate analysis:**
- Positive rates indicate longs pay shorts (bullish market bias)
- Negative rates indicate shorts pay longs (bearish market bias)
- Rate magnitude shows intensity of directional demand

**Premium components:**
- Premium represents the difference between perpetual and spot prices
- Combined with interest rate component to determine final funding rate
- Higher premiums suggest stronger directional pressure

**Time series patterns:**
- Funding rates typically reset every 8 hours
- Persistent positive funding indicates sustained bullish sentiment
- Rate volatility reflects changing market conditions

## Market analysis insights

### Sentiment indicators

**Directional bias measurement:**
- Consistently positive funding rates suggest bullish market structure
- Negative funding periods indicate bearish sentiment dominance
- Rate reversals often coincide with market trend changes

**Market efficiency:**
- Extreme funding rates indicate pricing inefficiencies
- Rate mean reversion suggests arbitrage opportunities
- Funding rate divergence across assets reveals relative strength

### Trading strategy applications

**Carry trade opportunities:**
- Identify assets with consistently favorable funding rates
- Calculate cumulative funding costs for position holding periods
- Optimize position timing around funding rate cycles

**Position management:**
- Avoid high-cost funding periods for direction-neutral strategies
- Time entries and exits around funding rate extremes
- Use funding rate trends for position sizing decisions

### Risk management

**Cost analysis:**
- Calculate total funding costs as percentage of trading profits
- Monitor funding rate volatility for strategy stability
- Assess impact of funding on long-term position holding

**Market timing:**
- Use funding rate extremes as contrarian indicators
- Identify potential trend reversal points
- Combine with other metrics for comprehensive market analysis

## Historical patterns

### Cycle analysis

**Funding rate cycles:**
- Identify recurring patterns in funding rate behavior
- Analyze seasonal effects and market cycle correlations
- Track funding rate recovery periods after extreme events

**Cross-asset comparison:**
- Compare funding rates across different perpetual contracts
- Identify relative value opportunities between assets
- Analyze correlation patterns during market stress

### Market structure insights

**Liquidity conditions:**
- High funding rate volatility often indicates lower liquidity
- Stable funding rates suggest efficient arbitrage mechanisms
- Rate spikes may indicate temporary liquidity shortages

**Institutional vs retail participation:**
- Funding rate patterns can reveal trader composition changes
- Professional arbitrageurs tend to stabilize funding rates
- Retail-driven markets often show more volatile funding patterns
