Base API method `web3_sha3` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the given data. This method is a utility function often used in Base for generating hashes of arbitrary data, which is a common requirement for various cryptographic operations.

This example computes Keccak-256 for the value `Chainstack`.

`Chainstack` in hex: `0x436861696E737461636B`.

## Parameters

* `data` — the data to hash, typically provided as a hexadecimal string.

## Response

* `result` — the Keccak-256 hash of the input data, returned as a hexadecimal string.

## Use case

The `web3_sha3` method is essential for:

* Generating identifiers or hashes for on-chain data storage or referencing.
* Creating cryptographic proofs that require a hash of data.
* Developers needing to perform off-chain hash calculations that match the Base network's hashing algorithm.
