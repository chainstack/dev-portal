Tracing and debugging on the Monad blockchain can be done by using the following methods:

  <Card title="debug_traceBlockByNumber" icon="angle-right" iconType="solid" href="/reference/monad-traceblockbynumber" horizontal/>

  <Card title="debug_traceCall" icon="angle-right" iconType="solid" href="/reference/monad-tracecall" horizontal/>
</CardGroup>

These methods support multiple tracers including:

* **callTracer** — traces all calls made during execution
* **prestateTracer** — returns the state accessed during execution
* **stateDiffTracer** — returns state changes made during execution

This information can be used for:

* **Debugging** — understand why transactions failed or behaved unexpectedly.
* **Security analysis** — analyze contract interactions and fund flows.
* **Gas optimization** — identify expensive operations in contract execution.
* **Forensics** — trace transaction paths for audit and compliance.
