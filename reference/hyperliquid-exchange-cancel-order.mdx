## Use cases

* **Risk management** — Quickly cancel orders when market conditions change
* **Order management** — Clean up open orders that are no longer needed
* **Algorithmic trading** — Programmatically manage order lifecycle
* **Portfolio rebalancing** — Cancel orders before placing new ones

<Note>
You can cancel multiple orders in a single request by including multiple objects in the `cancels` array. Each cancellation is processed independently.
</Note>

<Warning>
Attempting to cancel an order that doesn't exist, was already canceled, or was filled will return an error but won't affect other cancellations in the same request.
