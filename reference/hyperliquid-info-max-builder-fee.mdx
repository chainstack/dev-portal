This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available on Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support them yet — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `info` endpoint with `type: "maxBuilderFee"` retrieves the maximum builder fee that a user has approved for a specific builder on the Hyperliquid network. This endpoint is essential for understanding fee arrangements between users and builders in the MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) ecosystem.

## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"maxBuilderFee"` to retrieve the maximum builder fee.
* `user` (string, required) — User address in 42-character hexadecimal format (e.g., `0x47fc45cebfc47cef07a09a98405b6ebaef00ef75`).
* `builder` (string, required) — Builder address in 42-character hexadecimal format (e.g., `0x1922810825c90f4270048b96da7b1803cd8609ef`).

## Response

The response is a single integer representing the maximum builder fee:

* **Fee value** (integer) — Maximum fee approved in tenths of a basis point
  * Example: `1` means 0.001% (1/10 of a basis point)
  * Example: `10` means 0.01% (1 basis point)
  * Example: `100` means 0.1% (10 basis points)

### Understanding builder fees

**Builder fee structure:**
- Fees are expressed in tenths of a basis point for precise control
- One basis point = 0.01%, so one tenth of a basis point = 0.001%
- This granular fee structure allows for competitive builder markets

**Fee approval process:**
- Users pre-approve maximum fees for specific builders
- Actual fees charged may be less than the approved maximum
- Approvals can be updated or revoked as needed
- Zero values indicate no fee approval for that builder

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "maxBuilderFee", "user": "0x47fc45cebfc47cef07a09a98405b6ebaef00ef75", "builder": "0x1922810825c90f4270048b96da7b1803cd8609ef"}' \

## Example response

```json
1
```

This response indicates that the user has approved a maximum builder fee of 1 tenth of a basis point (0.001%) for the specified builder.
