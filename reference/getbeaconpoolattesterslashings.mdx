**Empty response data**

Attester slashings are infrequent events, so most of the time you will get an empty response.

The `/eth/v1/beacon/pool/attester_slashings` method is an integral part of the Ethereum Beacon Chain API, providing information about attester slashings. Attester slashing occurs when a validator, responsible for attesting to the state of the blockchain, is found to have attested conflicting information. This is a severe violation in the Ethereum PoS protocol, as it undermines the network's security and consensus mechanism.

This endpoint is of particular importance to network participants and developers, offering insights into instances of protocol violations and maintaining the integrity of the Beacon Chain.

### Parameters

* `none`

### Response

* `array` — list of attester slashing objects.
  + Each `object` in the array represents an attester slashing event, encompassing:
    - `attestation_1` and `attestation_2` — the conflicting attestations made by the slashed validator. These attestations are the evidence of the violation. They include:
      * `aggregation_bits`: A bitlist representing the committee members who are attesting.
      * `data`: The beacon block data being attested to, including the slot, beacon block root, source, and target.
      * `signature`: The signature of the attesting validator(s), verifying their attestation.
    - `validator_indices` — the indices of the validators involved in the slashing event. These indices identify the validators who have been penalized for their actions.
    - `message_hashes` — hashes of the attester slashing messages, serving as a cryptographic proof of the event.

The `/eth/v1/beacon/pool/attester_slashings` method is a critical component for monitoring the ethical and rule-abiding behavior of validators in the Ethereum network, ensuring the overall health and trustworthiness of the blockchain.
