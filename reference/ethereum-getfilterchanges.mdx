Filters can be created using one of the following methods:

* [eth\_newFilter](/reference/ethereum-newfilter)
* [eth\_newPendingTransactionFilter](/reference/ethereum-newpendingtransactionfilter)
* [eth\_newBlockFilter](/reference/ethereum-newblockfilter)

After creating a filter using one of the available methods, the resulting filter ID can be used to fetch changes by calling the `eth_getFilterChanges` method.

<Warning>
**Disclaimer**

Note that the default interactive example in this page will not work as the filter will be expired.

To test `eth_getFilterChanges` in this page, first create a new filter using one of the following:

* [eth\_newFilter](/reference/ethereum-newfilter)
* [eth\_newPendingTransactionFilter](/reference/ethereum-newpendingtransactionfilter)
* [eth\_newBlockFilter](/reference/ethereum-newblockfilter)

Then use the fresh filter ID as the parameter for `eth_getFilterChanges`.
</Warning>


## Parameters

* `string` — the filter ID of the filter for which you want to retrieve the changes

## Response

* `array` — an array that represents the changes that have occurred on the blockchain since the last time the filter was polled:
  + For filters created with `eth_newBlockFilter`:
    - `blockHash` — the hashes of the new blocks since the last time the filter was polled.
  + For filters created with `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter`:
    - `transactionHash` — the hashes identifying new pending transactions since the last time the filter was polled.
  + For filters created with `eth_newFilter`, the following event logs:
    - `address` — the contract address from which the event originated.
    - `topics` — an array of 32-byte data fields containing indexed event parameters.
    - `data` — the non-indexed data that was emitted along with the event.
    - `blocknumber` — the block number in which the event was included. `null` if it is pending.
    - `transactionhash` — the hash of the transaction that triggered the event. `null` if pending.
    - `transactionindex` — the integer index of the transaction within the block's list of transactions. `null` if it is pending.
    - `blockhash` — the hash of the block in which the event was included. `null` if it is pending.
    - `logindex` — the integer identifying the index of the event within the block's list of events. `null` if pending.
    - `removed` — the boolean value indicating if the event was removed from the blockchain due to a chain reorganization. `True` if the log was removed. `False` if it is a valid log.

## Use case

The `eth_getFilterChanges` method can be used to periodically poll a filter to retrieve new data. In the following Python program, using the web3.py library creates a filter using [eth\_newBlockFilter](/reference/ethereum-newblockfilter) to poll for new blocks, and uses `eth_getFilterChanges` to poll the filter and retrieve new blocks.

Here is the implementation in Python:

```python main.py
from web3 import Web3  
node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL" 
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url))

def get_new_blocks():
    try:
        blocks_filter = web3.eth.filter('latest')
        return blocks_filter
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

def get_filtered_events(filter_id):
    try:
        filter_changes = web3.eth.get_filter_changes(filter_id)
        return filter_changes # the array of events that match the filter
    except Exception as e:
        print(f'Error getting filter changes: {e}')

def main():
    # Create a block filter
    blocks = get_new_blocks()
    block_filter_id = blocks.filter_id
    
    if block_filter_id is not None:
        print(f'New block filter ID: {block_filter_id}')
    else:
        print('Error creating block filter')
        return

    # Loop forever and poll the filter every 10 seconds
    while True:
        print('Polling for new blocks...')
        new_blocks = get_filtered_events(block_filter_id)
        if new_blocks is not None:
            print(new_blocks)
        else:
            print('Error getting filter changes')
        time.sleep(5)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```


Here is the explanation of the code:

The `create_block_filter` function creates a new block filter with the `web3.eth.filter('latest')` method, which matches against the latest block. The resulting filter object is converted to a string, split into parts using the `split` method and the filter ID is extracted from the second part using array indexing. The filter ID is then returned by the function.

The `get_filtered_events` function uses the `eth_getFilterChanges` method to retrieve the new blocks. The function takes a single parameter, `filter_id`, which is a string that represents the ID of the filter to be polled, the filter created by the `create_block_filter` function in this case.

If the filter ID is valid, `get_filtered_events` calls `web3.eth.getFilterChanges(filter_id)` to retrieve the array of events that match the filter criteria. This array is then returned by the function, which is then printed to the console in the `main` function.

The `main` function encapsulates the program logic, calling `create_block_filter` to create a new block filter and print the resulting filter ID to the console. The function then enters an infinite loop, calling `get_filtered_events` every 10 seconds to retrieve the changes to the blockchain that match the filter criteria. If the changes are not `None`, they are printed to the console. An error message is printed to the console if an error occurs while creating the block filter or retrieving the filter changes.
