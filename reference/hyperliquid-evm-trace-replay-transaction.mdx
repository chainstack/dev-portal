## Parameters

1. **Transaction hash** (string, required): Hash of the transaction to replay
2. **Trace types** (array, required): Array of trace types to include in response

### Trace types

- `"trace"`: Basic execution trace information
- `"vmTrace"`: Virtual machine execution trace
- `"stateDiff"`: State differences caused by the transaction

## Response

The method returns detailed trace information for the replayed transaction.

### Response structure

**Transaction trace:**
- `trace` â€” Array of trace objects containing execution details
- Each trace contains action details, results, and call hierarchy

## Usage example

### Basic implementation

```javascript
// Replay a specific transaction with tracing
const replayTransaction = async (txHash, traceTypes = ['trace']) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/YOUR_ENDPOINT/evm', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      method: 'trace_replayTransaction',
      params: [txHash, traceTypes],
      id: 1
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.result;
};

// Example usage
const txHash = '0x07712544ce8f50091c6c3b227921f763b342bf9465a22f0226d651a3246adb31';
replayTransaction(txHash).then(result => {
  console.log('Transaction replay result:');
  if (result.trace) {
    result.trace.forEach((trace, index) => {
      console.log(`Trace ${index + 1}:`);
      console.log(`  Type: ${trace.type}`);
      console.log(`  Gas used: ${parseInt(trace.result.gasUsed, 16)}`);
    });
  }
});
```

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
