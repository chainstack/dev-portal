## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"frontendOpenOrders"` to retrieve user's open orders with frontend formatting.
* `user` (string, required) — Address in 42-character hexadecimal format (e.g., `0x31ca8395cf837de08b24da3f660e77761dfb974b`).
* `dex` (string, optional) — Perp dex name. Defaults to the empty string which represents the first perp dex. Spot open orders are only included with the first perp dex.

## Response

The response is an array of open order objects with enhanced frontend-specific information:

### Core order fields

* `coin` (string) — Trading pair or asset symbol (e.g., "BTC", "ETH")
* `limitPx` (string) — Limit price of the order in string format for precision
* `oid` (integer) — Order ID, a unique identifier for the order
* `side` (string) — Order side:
  * `"A"` — Ask (sell order)
  * `"B"` — Bid (buy order)
* `sz` (string) — Current order size in string format for precision
* `timestamp` (integer) — Order creation timestamp in milliseconds

### Frontend-enhanced fields

* `origSz` (string) — Original order size when the order was created
* `orderType` (string) — Human-readable order type (e.g., "Limit", "Market", "Stop", "Stop Limit")
* `triggerCondition` (string) — Trigger condition for conditional orders
* `triggerPx` (string) — Trigger price for conditional orders
* `reduceOnly` (boolean) — Whether this is a reduce-only order that can only decrease position size
* `isPositionTpsl` (boolean) — Whether this is a position take-profit/stop-loss order
* `isTrigger` (boolean) — Whether this is a trigger order

### Order side interpretation

* **"A" (Ask)**: Sell order - user wants to sell the asset at the specified price
* **"B" (Bid)**: Buy order - user wants to buy the asset at the specified price

### Order types

* **Limit**: Standard limit order at a specific price
* **Market**: Immediate execution at current market price
* **Stop**: Stop-loss order triggered when price reaches trigger level
* **Stop Limit**: Stop order that becomes a limit order when triggered
