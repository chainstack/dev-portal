## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"userFills"` to retrieve user fills.
* `user` (string, required) — Address in 42-character hexadecimal format; e.g. 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000.
* `aggregateByTime` (boolean, optional) — When true, partial fills are combined when a crossing order gets filled by multiple different resting orders. Resting orders filled by multiple crossing orders will not be aggregated.

## Response

The response is an array of fill objects, with each fill containing detailed trade information:

### Fill data structure

Each fill object contains the following fields:

**Core trade data:**
- `coin` — Asset identifier (simple names like "BTC", "ETH" for perpetuals; spot format like "@107" for spot trades)
- `px` — Fill price as a string for precision
- `sz` — Fill size (quantity traded)
- `side` — Trade side: "A" for Ask/Sell, "B" for Bid/Buy
- `time` — Fill timestamp in milliseconds
- `oid` — Order ID that generated this fill
- `tid` — Unique trade ID

**Position and P&L data:**
- `startPosition` — Position size before this fill
- `dir` — Trade direction (e.g., "Open Long", "Close Short", "Buy", "Sell")
- `closedPnl` — Realized profit/loss from this fill
- `crossed` — Boolean indicating if this was a crossing order

**Fee and transaction data:**
- `fee` — Trading fee paid for this fill
- `feeToken` — Token used to pay the fee (typically "USDC")
- `builderFee` — Builder fee (optional, only present if non-zero)
- `hash` — Transaction hash for blockchain verification

### Asset identification

**Perpetual contracts:**
- Use simple asset names: "BTC", "ETH", "AVAX", "SOL"
- Represent standard perpetual futures contracts

**Spot markets:**
- Use indexed format: "@107", "@1", etc.
- Index corresponds to the spot pair position in the universe
- Some assets may have remapped names in user interfaces

### Data limitations

**Response limits:**
- Maximum 2000 fills per response
- Returns most recent fills first
- For larger datasets, use pagination with `userFillsByTime`

**Historical availability:**
- Only the 10,000 most recent fills are available
- Older fills are not accessible through this endpoint
