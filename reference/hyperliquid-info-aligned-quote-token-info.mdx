<Info>
This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available on Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support them yet — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `info` endpoint with `type: "alignedQuoteTokenInfo"` retrieves supply, rate, and pending payment information for an aligned quote token. Aligned quote tokens are HIP-1 spot tokens that deployers have registered as collateral for HIP-3 perpetual DEXes through the CoreWriter contract on HyperEVM.

Returns `null` if the token has not been registered as an aligned quote asset.

## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"alignedQuoteTokenInfo"`.
* `token` (integer, required) — Spot token index from the `spotMeta` universe (e.g., `0` for USDC, `1` for PURR). Only tokens registered as aligned quote assets return data.

## Response

Returns an aligned quote token info object, or `null` if the token is not registered as an aligned quote asset.

* `isAligned` (boolean) — Whether the token is currently aligned.
* `firstAlignedTime` (integer) — Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the token was first aligned.
* `evmMintedSupply` (string) — Total EVM minted supply of the token as reported by CoreWriter.
* `dailyAmountOwed` (array) — Array of `[date, amount]` tuples showing daily owed amounts, where `date` is a `YYYY-MM-DD` string and `amount` is a decimal string.
* `predictedRate` (string) — Predicted alignment rate as a decimal string.

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "alignedQuoteTokenInfo", "token": 1}' \
  https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/4f8d8f4040bdacd1577bff8058438274/info
```

## Example response

When the token is an aligned quote asset:

```json
{
  "isAligned": true,
  "firstAlignedTime": 1759914226913,
  "evmMintedSupply": "0.0",
  "dailyAmountOwed": [
    ["2025-10-08", "0.0"],
    ["2025-10-09", "0.0"]
  ],
  "predictedRate": "0.03154807"
}
```

When the token is not an aligned quote asset:

```json
null
```

## Use case

The `info` endpoint with `type: "alignedQuoteTokenInfo"` is useful for:

* Checking whether a HIP-1 token is registered as an aligned quote asset before deploying a HIP-3 perp DEX with it as collateral
* Monitoring the EVM minted supply and daily owed amounts for aligned tokens
* Building dashboards that track alignment status and rates for custom quote tokens
