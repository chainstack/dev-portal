## `eth_blockNumber` code examples

<CodeGroup>
```javascript ethers.js
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL");

async function getBlockNumber() {
  const blockNumber = await provider.getBlockNumber();
  console.log(`Latest block: ${blockNumber}`);
}

getBlockNumber();
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3

node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL"

web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url))
print(web3.eth.block_number)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Use case

A practical use case for `eth_blockNumber` is tracking the current state of the blockchain. Applications can use the current block number to determine time-sensitive operations, such as calculating when a time-locked contract will become executable or monitoring network progress.
