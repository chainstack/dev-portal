<Info>
You can only use this endpoint on the official Hyperliquid public API. It is not available through Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support it yet. See [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

<Note>
This endpoint requires signature authentication. See our comprehensive [Authentication via Signatures guide](/docs/hyperliquid-authentication-guide) for implementation details.
</Note>

Modifies multiple existing orders in a single atomic request on the Hyperliquid exchange. This is more efficient than sending individual modify requests for each order.

## Batch processing

* **Atomic execution** — All modifications are processed together
* **Independent validation** — Each modification is validated independently
* **Partial success** — Some orders may succeed while others fail
* **Efficiency** — Single signature and request for multiple modifications

## Use cases

* **Market making** — Update multiple orders across different price levels
* **Portfolio management** — Adjust multiple positions simultaneously
* **Grid trading** — Modify entire grids of orders efficiently
* **Strategy updates** — Bulk update orders when strategy parameters change

<Note>
Batch modifications are processed sequentially in the order provided. If one modification fails, it doesn't affect the others in the batch.
</Note>

<Warning>
Each modification in the batch counts toward rate limits. Ensure you don't exceed rate limits when modifying many orders at once.
</Warning>
