title: Retrieve blobs by block ID
openapi: /openapi/ethereum_beacon_chain_api/state/getBlobsByBlockId.json GET
  /0a9d79d93fb2f4a4b1e04695da2b77a7/eth/v1/beacon/blobs/{block_id}
---

The `/eth/v1/beacon/blobs/{block_id}` method retrieves information about blobs by block ID. This endpoint is crucial for accessing detailed data contained within blobs, including the slot, epoch, and the associated data. It enables developers and users to programmatically interact with and analyze the blob data associated with Ethereum's beacon chain, which is especially useful in the context of rollups and data-intensive operations.

## Parameters

* `block_id` — the block identifier to retrieve blobs for. This can be one of the following:
  * `head` — the head of the chain
  * `genesis` — the genesis block
  * `finalized` — the most recent finalized block
  * A slot number
  * A hex-encoded block root with `0x` prefix

## Response

The response is an object containing the following fields:

* `data` — an array of blob objects, each containing:
  * `blob` — a hexadecimal string representing the actual blob data. This field provides the raw data that rollups or other Ethereum layer 2 solutions have submitted for inclusion in a block.
  * `index` — the index of the blob within the block
  * `kzg_commitment` — the KZG commitment for the blob
  * `kzg_proof` — the KZG proof for the blob
  * `signed_block_header` — the signed block header associated with the blob
