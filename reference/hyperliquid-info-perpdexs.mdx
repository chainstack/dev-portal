openapi: /openapi/hyperliquid_node_api/info_perpdexs.json post /4f8d8f4040bdacd1577bff8058438274/info
---

<Info>
This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available on Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support them yet — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

<Note>
The `perpDexs` call will return non-null when [HIP-3: Builder-Deployed Perpetuals](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/hyperliquid-improvement-proposals-hips/hip-3-builder-deployed-perpetuals) goes live on the mainnet.
</Note>

The `info` endpoint with `type: "perpDexs"` retrieves information about all available perpetual DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges) on the Hyperliquid ecosystem. This endpoint provides basic identification and deployment information for each perpetual DEX instance.

## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"perpDexs"` to retrieve perpetual DEXs information.

## Response

The response is an array of perpetual DEX information. Each element in the array can be:

### Default DEX (first element)

* `null` — Represents the default/first perpetual DEX

### Additional DEXs

For non-default DEXs, each object contains:

* `name` (string) — Short name of the perpetual DEX
* `full_name` (string) — Full descriptive name of the DEX
* `deployer` (string) — Ethereum address of the DEX deployer in 42-character hexadecimal format
* `oracle_updater` (string or null) — Address responsible for oracle updates, or null if not applicable

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "perpDexs"}' \
  https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/4f8d8f4040bdacd1577bff8058438274/info
```

## Example response

```json
[
  null,
  {
    "name": "test",
    "full_name": "test dex",
    "deployer": "0x5e89b26d8d66da9888c835c9bfcc2aa51813e152",
    "oracle_updater": null
  }
]
```

## Use case

The `info` endpoint with `type: "perpDexs"` is essential for applications that need to:

* **DEX enumeration**: List available perpetual DEX instances on Hyperliquid
* **DEX identification**: Identify DEX names and deployment information
* **Integration mapping**: Map DEX names to their deployer addresses for integration purposes
* **System discovery**: Discover available trading venues within the Hyperliquid ecosystem
* **Oracle tracking**: Identify which DEXs have oracle updaters and their addresses
* **Deployment monitoring**: Track DEX deployments and their associated addresses
* **Multi-DEX support**: Build applications that can work with multiple DEX instances
* **Administration tools**: Create tools for managing and monitoring DEX instances

This endpoint provides basic information about the perpetual DEX ecosystem on Hyperliquid, allowing applications to discover and identify available trading venues.
