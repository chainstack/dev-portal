## `net_version` code examples

<CodeGroup>
```javascript ethers.js
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL");

async function getNetworkVersion() {
  const networkVersion = await provider.send("net_version", []);
  console.log(`Network ID: ${networkVersion}`);
}

getNetworkVersion();
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3

node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL"

web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url))
network_id = web3.net.version
print(f'Network ID: {network_id}')
```

## Use case

A practical use case for `net_version` is validating that your application is connected to the expected network before sending transactions, preventing accidental transactions on the wrong network.
