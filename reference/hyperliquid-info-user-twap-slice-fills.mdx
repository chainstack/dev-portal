<Info>
You can only use this endpoint on the official Hyperliquid public API. It is not available through Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support it yet. See [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `info` endpoint with `type: "userTwapSliceFills"` retrieves a user's TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) slice fills on the Hyperliquid exchange. This endpoint provides detailed information about individual fill executions that result from TWAP order slicing, enabling analysis of TWAP execution quality and performance.

## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"userTwapSliceFills"` to retrieve TWAP slice fills.
* `user` (string, required) — Address in 42-character hexadecimal format; e.g. 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000.

## Response

The response is an array of TWAP slice fill objects, each containing detailed fill information and the associated TWAP order ID:

### Response structure

Each TWAP slice fill object contains:
- `fill` — Detailed fill information object (similar to regular fills)
- `twapId` — Unique identifier for the TWAP order that generated this slice fill

### Fill data structure

The `fill` object contains comprehensive execution information:

**Core trade data:**
- `coin` — Asset identifier (simple names like "BTC", "ETH" for perpetuals; spot format like "@107" for spot trades)
- `px` — Fill price as a string for precision
- `sz` — Fill size (quantity traded)
- `side` — Trade side: "A" for Ask/Sell, "B" for Bid/Buy
- `time` — Fill timestamp in milliseconds
- `oid` — Order ID that generated this fill
- `tid` — Unique trade ID

**Position and P&L data:**
- `startPosition` — Position size before this fill
- `dir` — Trade direction (e.g., "Open Long", "Close Short", "Buy", "Sell")
- `closedPnl` — Realized profit/loss from this fill
- `crossed` — Boolean indicating if this was a crossing order

**Fee and transaction data:**
- `fee` — Trading fee paid for this fill
- `feeToken` — Token used to pay the fee (typically "USDC")
- `hash` — Transaction hash (TWAP fills have a hash of all zeros)

**TWAP-specific characteristics:**
- `twapId` — Links this fill to the parent TWAP order
- `hash` — Always "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000" for TWAP fills

### Data limits and ordering

**Response limits:**
- Maximum 2000 most recent TWAP slice fills
- Results are ordered by time (most recent first)
- Older fills beyond the 2000 limit are not accessible

**TWAP execution context:**
- Each fill represents one slice execution from a larger TWAP order
- Multiple fills can share the same `twapId` if they're from the same TWAP order
- Fills show the actual execution details of TWAP slicing strategy

## TWAP order execution

### Understanding TWAP fills

**TWAP strategy:**
- Large orders are broken into smaller slices executed over time
- Each slice execution generates a separate fill record
- Goal is to achieve time-weighted average pricing and reduce market impact

**Slice execution:**
- Individual slices are executed as market conditions allow
- Each slice fill shows actual execution price and quantity
- Timing and sizing depend on TWAP algorithm parameters

**Execution tracking:**
- `twapId` groups all fills from the same TWAP order
- Sequential fills show the progression of TWAP execution
- Total execution = sum of all fills with the same `twapId`

### TWAP vs regular fills

**Key differences:**
- TWAP fills have zero hash (`0x000...000`)
- TWAP fills are linked by `twapId`
- TWAP fills represent algorithmic execution slices
- Regular fills represent direct order executions

### Asset identification

**Perpetual contracts:**
- Use simple asset names: "BTC", "ETH", "AVAX", "SOL"
- Represent standard perpetual futures contracts

**Spot markets:**
- Use indexed format: "@107", "@1", etc.
- Index corresponds to the spot pair position in the universe
- Some assets may have remapped names in user interfaces

## Performance analysis

### TWAP execution metrics

**Price performance:**
- Compare individual slice prices to market benchmarks
- Analyze price improvement or slippage across slices
- Calculate volume-weighted average price (VWAP) achieved

**Timing analysis:**
- Review execution timing across the TWAP duration
- Analyze market impact of individual slices
- Assess execution completion rate and timing

**Cost analysis:**
- Sum fees across all slices for total execution cost
- Compare TWAP execution costs to alternative strategies
- Analyze fee efficiency of slice sizing
