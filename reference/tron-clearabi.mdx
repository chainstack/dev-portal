TRON API method that clears (removes) the ABI (Application Binary Interface) information from a smart contract. This operation removes the contract's ABI data from the blockchain, making the contract functions less discoverable but still executable if the function signatures are known.

## Parameters

* `owner_address` — address of the contract owner who can clear the ABI
* `contract_address` — address of the smart contract to clear ABI for
* `visible` — boolean indicating whether to use visible (Base58) address format instead of hex

## Response

* `visible` — boolean indicating whether addresses are in visible format
* `txID` — unique transaction ID for the ABI clearing transaction
* `raw_data` — raw transaction data containing:
  * `contract` — array with contract ABI clearing details
  * `ref_block_bytes` — reference block bytes for transaction validation
  * `ref_block_hash` — hash of the reference block
  * `expiration` — transaction expiration timestamp
  * `timestamp` — transaction creation timestamp
* `raw_data_hex` — complete transaction data encoded in hexadecimal format

## Use case

The `wallet/clearabi` method is used for:

* Removing contract ABI information for privacy or security reasons.
* Cleaning up contract metadata when ABI information is no longer needed.
* Implementing obfuscation strategies for proprietary smart contracts.
* Managing contract visibility and discoverability in explorers.
* Reducing on-chain storage by removing unnecessary ABI data.
* Preparing contracts for migration or deprecation processes.

<Warning>
Clearing the ABI makes the contract less user-friendly as tools and interfaces will not be able to automatically understand the contract's functions. However, the contract remains fully functional and can still be called using raw function signatures and data.
