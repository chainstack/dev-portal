<Info>
This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `ots_getContractCreator` JSON-RPC method retrieves the transaction hash and creator address for a deployed contract on the Hyperliquid EVM blockchain. This Otterscan-specific method helps identify who deployed a smart contract and in which transaction.

## Parameters

1. **contract address** (string, required): The address of the deployed contract

## Response

The method returns an object containing the creator address and deployment transaction hash, or null if the address is not a contract or information is unavailable.

### Response structure

- `hash` — the transaction hash where the contract was created
- `creator` — the address that deployed the contract

## Usage example

```shell Shell
curl -X POST https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/4f8d8f4040bdacd1577bff8058438274/evm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "ots_getContractCreator",
    "params": ["0x5555555555555555555555555555555555555555"],
    "id": 1
  }'
```

### Example response (contract found)

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "hash": "0xf94f3d2ed5b59aefb6a0e566af8e86552014d84f6ed2f38a1366dedffe723381",
    "creator": "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"
  }
}
```

### Example response (not a contract)

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": null
}
```

## Contract creation methods

This method detects contracts created through:
- Direct deployment transactions
- CREATE opcode from other contracts
- CREATE2 opcode for deterministic addresses

## Use cases

The `ots_getContractCreator` method is essential for:

* **Contract verification**: Verify the authenticity of contract deployments
* **Security auditing**: Identify who deployed suspicious contracts
* **Attribution tracking**: Link contracts to their deployers
* **Factory pattern analysis**: Track contracts created by factory contracts
* **Deployment history**: Research when and by whom contracts were deployed
* **Trust verification**: Verify contracts were deployed by expected addresses
* **Forensic investigation**: Trace the origin of malicious contracts
* **Documentation**: Record deployment information for contract registries
* **Multi-sig verification**: Confirm contracts deployed by authorized accounts
* **Development debugging**: Track contract deployments during testing

This method is particularly valuable for security analysis and verifying the provenance of smart contracts in DeFi protocols.
