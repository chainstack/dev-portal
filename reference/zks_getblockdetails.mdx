## Parameters

This method requires a single input parameter:

* `block` — a `uint32` value representing the block number for which details are being requested. This is a specific identifier for the block within the zkSync Layer 2 network.

## Response

Upon execution, the `zks_getBlockDetails` method returns an object with information about the block:

* `baseSystemContractsHashes` — an object containing hashes of the base system contracts involved in the block's transactions, offering insights into the foundational components of the zkSync network for this block. This includes:
  + `bootloader` — the hash of the bootloader contract.
  + `default_aa` — the hash of the default account abstraction contract.
* `commitTxHash` — the hash of the transaction that has been committed to the network, marking the initial stage of the transaction's lifecycle on Layer 1.
* `committedAt` — the timestamp (ISO 8601 format) indicating when the transaction was committed to the network, providing a precise temporal context.
* `executeTxHash` — the transaction hash executed on the network, signifying the application of the transaction's effects on the zkSync state.
* `executedAt` — the timestamp (ISO 8601 format) when the transaction was executed on the network, marking the completion of its effects on the state.
* `l1BatchNumber` — the batch number associated with this transaction on the Layer 1 (Ethereum) network, linking the zkSync activity back to its Ethereum roots.
* `l1GasPrice` — the gas price utilized for the transaction on the Layer 1 network, reflecting the cost of execution on Ethereum.
* `l1TxCount` — the number of transactions related to this batch on the Layer 1 network, providing a measure of the batch's complexity and size.
* `l2FairGasPrice` — the fair gas price applied to transactions within the zkSync network.
* `l2TxCount` — the total number of transactions processed within this block on the Layer 2 network, indicating the block's activity level.
* `number` — the specific number of the block within the zkSync blockchain.
* `operatorAddress` — the address of the operator who executed the transaction, offering accountability and traceability within the network's operations.
* `proveTxHash` — the hash of the proof transaction on the Layer 1 network, crucial for validating the block's integrity and finality.
* `provenAt` — the timestamp (ISO 8601 format) when the proof transaction was completed on the Layer 1 network, marking a key verification step.
* `rootHash` — the root hash representing the updated state of the network following the transaction, essential for ensuring network consistency.
* `status` — the status of the block.
* `timestamp` — the UNIX timestamp marking the time of the block's processing, providing a global temporal reference.

## Use case

A blockchain analytics platform may use the `zks_getBlockDetails` method to track block statuses, analyze gas prices or monitor operator activity. Similarly, a wallet service could leverage this data to inform users about the confirmation and finality of their transactions, enhancing trust and transparency in the service.
