TRON API method that broadcasts a transaction to the TRON network using hexadecimal format. This method allows you to submit pre-signed transactions directly to the blockchain without needing to use the standard JSON transaction format.

## Parameters

* `transaction` — the complete transaction data encoded in hexadecimal format, including all signatures and necessary fields

## Response

* `result` — boolean indicating whether the broadcast was successful
* `txid` — the transaction hash if the broadcast was successful
* `message` — descriptive message about the broadcast status

## Use case

The `wallet/broadcasthex` method is used for:

* Broadcasting pre-signed transactions in hex format to the TRON network.
* Submitting transactions that were created and signed offline for security purposes.
* Integrating with external signing tools and hardware wallets that output hex-encoded transactions.
* Building custom transaction broadcasting workflows that require hex format compatibility.
* Supporting legacy systems or tools that work with hexadecimal transaction data.

## curl example

The example below uses a syntactically valid transaction hex, so the node parses it and returns a JSON result. Because the signature is a placeholder, you should expect a logical error (for example, `SIGERROR`) rather than a parsing exception. Replace the `transaction` value with the full hex of a transaction you have actually signed to get `result: true`.

```shell Shell
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://tron-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/95e61622bf6a8af293978377718e3b77/wallet/broadcasthex' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "transaction": "0a84010a025e4b220847c9dc89341b300d40f8fed3a2a72e5a66080112620a2d747970652e676f6f676c65617069732e636f6d2f70726f746f636f6c2e5472616e73666572436f6e747261637412310a1541608f8da72479edc7dd921e4c30bb7e7cddbe722e121541e9d79cc47518930bc322d9bf7cddd260a0260a8d18e8077093afd0a2a72e1241deadbeefcafebabefacec0011234abcd0badf00d9999777755553333222211114321dcba0f0ff0f013579bdf2468ace0987654321a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0deeff1b"
  }'
```

<Tip>
to build the `transaction` hex from a signed transaction object:

- take the raw transaction bytes (`raw_data_hex`)
- prefix with `0a` then a protobuf varint of the raw bytes length
- append each signature as `12` + `41` + 65‑byte signature hex (repeat for multisig)

Most users should prefer creating the transaction with [`wallet/createtransaction`](/reference/tron-createtransaction), signing the exact `raw_data`, and then broadcasting via this method.
