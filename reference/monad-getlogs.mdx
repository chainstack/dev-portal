title: eth_getLogs | Monad
openapi: /openapi/monad_node_api/logs_and_events/eth_getLogs.json POST /
---

Monad API method that returns an array of all logs matching a given filter object. This is essential for tracking events emitted by smart contracts.

<Warning>
**Monad-specific behavior**: `eth_getLogs` has a maximum block range (typically 1000 blocks). Because Monad blocks are much larger than Ethereum blocks, use small block ranges (1-10 blocks) for optimal performance. Requests with longer ranges can take a long time or time out.

## Parameters

* `object` — the filter options:
  * `fromBlock` (optional) — integer block number, or `latest`, `earliest`, `pending`
  * `toBlock` (optional) — integer block number, or `latest`, `earliest`, `pending`
  * `address` (optional) — contract address or list of addresses from which logs should originate
  * `topics` (optional) — array of 32-byte data topics
  * `blockhash` (optional) — restricts logs to a single block with the given hash

## Response

* `result` — array of log objects, or an empty array if nothing has changed:
  * `removed` — `true` when the log was removed due to chain reorganization
  * `logIndex` — integer of the log index position in the block
  * `transactionIndex` — integer of the transaction's index position
  * `transactionHash` — hash of the transaction that generated this log
  * `blockHash` — hash of the block containing this log
  * `blockNumber` — block number containing this log
  * `address` — address from which this log originated
  * `data` — non-indexed arguments of the log
  * `topics` — array of indexed log arguments

## `eth_getLogs` code examples

<CodeGroup>
```javascript ethers.js
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL");

async function getLogs() {
  const logs = await provider.getLogs({
    fromBlock: "latest",
    toBlock: "latest",
    address: "0x..." // Optional: filter by contract address
  });
  console.log(logs);
}

getLogs();
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3

node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL"

web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url))

logs = web3.eth.get_logs({
    'fromBlock': 'latest',
    'toBlock': 'latest',
    'address': '0x...' # Optional: filter by contract address
})

for log in logs:
    print(log)
```

## Use case

A practical use case for `eth_getLogs` is tracking specific events from smart contracts, such as token transfers, swaps, or any custom events defined in your contracts.
