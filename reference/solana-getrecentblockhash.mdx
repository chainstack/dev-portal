The Solana `getRecentBlockhash` method returns a recent block hash from the ledger, and a fee schedule that can be used to compute the cost of submitting a transaction using it.

This method is crucial for transaction construction and submission in Solana. The returned blockhash is used to indicate when a transaction was constructed, which is important for security reasons. The fee calculator provides information about the current network fees.
