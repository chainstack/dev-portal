## Parameters

* `source` (string, required) — The source address of the result transaction. Example: `UQAX2d4C2d48JeA-0y2_peGabRVumnKY22xPvkuEayC3zTI1`.
* `destination` (string, required) — The destination address of the result transaction. Example: `UQBP4mzpDIywL1SV-Wp9ZuBBlzprR9eXQgSYGEXiUEHm73vA`.
* `created_lt` (string, required) — The logical time when the result transaction was created. Example: `47597573000002`.

## JSON-RPC example

    }
  }'
```


## Response

* `block` (object) — Information about the block containing the source transaction:
  + `workchain` (integer) — The workchain ID of the block.
  + `shard` (string) — The shard ID of the block.
  + `seqno` (integer) — The sequence number of the block.
  + `root_hash` (string) — The root hash of the block.
  + `file_hash` (string) — The file hash of the block.
* `transaction_id` (object) — The identifier of the source transaction:
  + `lt` (string) — The logical time of the source transaction.
  + `hash` (string) — The hash of the source transaction.

## Use case

A possible use case for the `tryLocateSourceTx` method in TON is for applications or services that need to trace the origin of transactions. This method can be used to:

1. Implement transaction history tracing in blockchain explorers.
2. Analyze the chain of events leading to a specific transaction.
3. Verify the authenticity of a transaction by tracing it back to its source.
4. Debug smart contract interactions by identifying the initiating transaction.
