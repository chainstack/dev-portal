## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"spotClearinghouseState"` to retrieve user's spot token balances.
* `user` (string, required) — Onchain address in 42-character hexadecimal format (e.g., `0x2ba553d9f990a3b66b03b2dc0d030dfc1c061036`).

## Response

The response contains detailed balance information:

### Balances

An array of the user's spot token balances:

* `coin` (string) — Token symbol (e.g., "USDC", "PURR").
* `token` (integer) — Token index identifier used internally by the exchange.
* `hold` (string) — Amount currently on hold (locked in open orders or pending transactions).
* `total` (string) — Total balance including both available and held amounts.
* `entryNtl` (string) — Entry notional value, used for PnL calculations and tracking cost basis.

### Balance calculation

The available balance for trading can be calculated as:
```
Available Balance = Total - Hold
```

For example, if `total` is "14.625485" and `hold` is "0.0", then the available balance is "14.625485".
