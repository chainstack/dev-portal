TRON API method that updates the origin energy limit for a smart contract. This setting determines the maximum amount of energy the contract creator provides for contract execution, affecting how much energy users need to provide when calling the contract.

## Parameters

* `owner_address` — address of the contract owner who can update the energy limit
* `contract_address` — address of the smart contract to update energy limit for
* `origin_energy_limit` — maximum energy amount the contract creator provides (in energy units, not TRX/sun)
* `visible` — boolean indicating whether to use visible (Base58) address format instead of hex

## Response

* `visible` — boolean indicating whether addresses are in visible format
* `txID` — unique transaction ID for the energy limit update transaction
* `raw_data` — raw transaction data containing:
  * `contract` — array with contract update details
  * `ref_block_bytes` — reference block bytes for transaction validation
  * `ref_block_hash` — hash of the reference block
  * `expiration` — transaction expiration timestamp
  * `timestamp` — transaction creation timestamp
* `raw_data_hex` — complete transaction data encoded in hexadecimal format

## Use case

The `wallet/updateenergylimit` method is used for:

* Setting energy subsidies for contract users to improve user experience.
* Managing contract execution costs by controlling energy allocation.
* Optimizing contract economics by adjusting energy provision strategies.
* Implementing freemium models where basic operations are subsidized.
* Balancing between contract owner costs and user accessibility.
* Adjusting energy limits based on contract usage patterns and feedback.

<Note>
Only the contract owner can update the origin energy limit. Higher limits mean the contract owner covers more execution costs, making the contract cheaper for users to interact with. The value is specified in energy units (not TRX/sun).

## curl example

```shell Shell
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://tron-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/95e61622bf6a8af293978377718e3b77/wallet/updateenergylimit' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "owner_address": "THPvaUhoh2Qn2y9THCZML3H815hhFhn5YC",
  "contract_address": "TR7NHqjeKQxGTCi8q8ZY4pL8otSzgjLj6t",
  "origin_energy_limit": 100000000,
  "visible": true
}'
```

This builds an unsigned transaction if the `owner_address` exists and is authorized (contract owner). Otherwise the node returns a validation error.

<Steps>
<Step title="verify owner account exists">
Use `wallet/getaccount` to make sure the address is activated and format matches `visible`.

```shell Shell
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://tron-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/95e61622bf6a8af293978377718e3b77/wallet/getaccount' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{ "address": "THPvaUhoh2Qn2y9THCZML3H815hhFhn5YC", "visible": true }'
```
</Step>

<Step title="confirm contract and owner">
`wallet/getcontract` expects a hex address. It returns `origin_address` (the deployer/owner) and current settings.

```shell Shell
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://tron-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/95e61622bf6a8af293978377718e3b77/wallet/getcontract' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{ "value": "41a614f803b6fd780986a42c78ec9c7f77e6ded13c" }'
```
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
common validation errors:

- `Account [41…] does not exist` — the payer address does not exist on-chain or the format does not match `visible`. Query it with `wallet/getaccount` and fund/activate it first.
- `No permission` or similar — the `owner_address` is not the contract owner; only the `origin_address` can update settings.
- `Contract not found` — check the contract address and use hex for `wallet/getcontract`.
