## What is the Ronin protocol?

Ronin is an EVM blockchain crafted for developers building games with player-owned economies. Ronin is conceptualized and implemented by Sky Mavis, the creators of Axie Infinity.

Find useful Ronin tools in the [Ronin tooling](/docs/ronin-tooling) section.

<Warning>
### Saigon testnet L1 to L2 migration

On February 5, 2026, the Ronin Saigon testnet migrated from L1 to an Ethereum L2 using the OP Stack at block 45,528,550. The chain ID changed from `2021` to `202601`.

On Chainstack Saigon testnet nodes, blocks 0–45,528,549 are served by the old L1 backend and blocks 45,528,550 onward are served by the new L2 backend. There is no block overlap—range-based methods like `eth_getLogs` cannot span both ranges in a single call. See [eth_getLogs](/reference/ronin-getlogs) for details.

The Ronin mainnet is also planned to migrate to an Ethereum L2 in Q1–Q2 2026. The mainnet chain ID will remain `2020`.

## What is the Ronin API

The Ronin API allows developers to communicate with the Ronin blockchain to build applications.

To read data from and send transactions to the Ronin blockchain, an application must connect to a Ronin RPC node.

When communicating with a Ronin RPC node, the Ronin client implements a JSON-RPC specification, a communication protocol allowing one to make remote calls and execute them as if they were made locally.

## How to start using the Ronin API

To use the Ronin API, you need access to a Ronin RPC node.

Follow these steps to sign up on Chainstack, deploy a Ronin RPC node, and find your endpoint credentials:

<Steps>
<Step>
[Sign up with Chainstack](https://console.chainstack.com/user/account/create).
</Step>
<Step>
[Deploy a node](/docs/manage-your-networks#join-a-public-network).
</Step>
<Step>
[View node access and credentials](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).
</Step>
</Steps>

Now you are ready to connect to the Ronin blockchain and use the Ronin API to build.
