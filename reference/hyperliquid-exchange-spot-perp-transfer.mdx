## Example request

<CodeGroup>

```shell cURL
# Transfer 100 USDC from spot to perp
curl -X POST https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/exchange \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": {
      "type": "spotUser",
      "classTransfer": {
        "usdc": 100000000,
        "toPerp": true
      }
    },
    "nonce": 1234567890123,
    "signature": {...}
  }'

# Transfer 50 USDC from perp to spot
curl -X POST https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/exchange \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": {
      "type": "spotUser",
      "classTransfer": {
        "usdc": 50000000,
        "toPerp": false
      }

```python Python
from hyperliquid.exchange import Exchange
from hyperliquid.utils import constants
import eth_account

# Initialize with your private key
account = eth_account.Account.from_key("0x...")
exchange = Exchange(account, constants.MAINNET_API_URL)

# Transfer 100 USDC from spot to perp
to_perp = exchange.spot_perp_transfer(
    amount=100.0,
    to_perp=True
)

# Transfer 50 USDC from perp to spot
to_spot = exchange.spot_perp_transfer(
    amount=50.0,
    to_perp=False
)

print(to_perp)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Response example

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "response": {
    "type": "default"
  }
}
```

## Important considerations

* **Balance requirements** — Must have sufficient balance in the source wallet
* **Instant transfer** — Transfers are immediate within Hyperliquid
* **No fees** — Internal transfers between spot and perp are free
* **Position checks** — Cannot transfer from perp if it would cause liquidation

## Use cases

* **Trading mode switch** — Move funds between spot and perpetual trading
* **Capital allocation** — Optimize fund distribution across trading strategies
* **Risk management** — Move profits from perp to spot for safer storage
* **Liquidity management** — Quickly reallocate capital based on opportunities

<Note>
USDC in the spot wallet can be used for spot trading and token purchases. USDC in the perp wallet is used as collateral for perpetual positions.
</Note>

<Warning>
When transferring from perp to spot, ensure you maintain sufficient margin for any open perpetual positions to avoid liquidation.
