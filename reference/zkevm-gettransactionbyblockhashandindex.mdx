## Parameters

* `hash` — the hash of the block
* `quantity` — the integer identifying the transaction index position within the block, encoded as hexadecimal

## Response

* `object` — a transaction response object, or `null` if no transaction is found:
  + `blockHash` — the block hash. Identifies the block in which the transaction was included. This field is `null` for transactions that have not yet been included in a block.
  + `blockNumber` — the number of the block in which the transaction was included. This field is `null` for transactions that have not yet been included in a block.
  + `from` — the address of the sender who initiated the transaction.
  + `gas` — the units of gas included in the transaction by the sender.
  + `gasPrice` — the price of gas in Wei included in the transaction by the sender.
  + `maxFeePerGas` — the maximum amount the transaction's sender is willing to pay per unit of gas for the transaction to be executed.
  + `maxPriorityFeePerGas` — the maximum priority fee the transaction sender is willing to pay per unit of gas.
  + `hash` — the hash that uniquely identifies the transaction.
  + `input` — the optional input data sent with the transaction, usually used to interact with smart contracts.
  + `nonce` — a counter identifying the transaction's number sent by the sender's wallet. It essentially identifies how many transactions an account has made. Used to ensure each transaction is executed only once.
  + `to` — the recipient's address of the transaction if it was a transaction to an address. For contract creation transactions, this field is `null`.
  + `transactionIndex` — the index of the transaction within the block. It is `null` for transactions that have not yet been included in a block.
  + `value` — the value of the native token transferred along with the transaction, in Wei.
  + `type` — the [type](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/#types-of-transactions) of the transaction. `0` indicates a regular transfer; `2` indicates a contract creation or smart contract function call.
  + `accessList` — a list of [authorized addresses and storage keys](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930#:~:text=The%20accessList%20specifies%20a%20list,of%20accessing%20outside%20the%20list.) with which the transaction plans to interact.
  + `v` — the recovery parameter in the [Ethereum Signature Algorithm](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#ecdsa) (ECDSA).
  + `r` — the first component of the signature in the [Ethereum Signature Algorithm](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#ecdsa) (ECDSA).
  + `s` — the second component of the signature in the [Ethereum Signature Algorithm](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#ecdsa) (ECDSA).
