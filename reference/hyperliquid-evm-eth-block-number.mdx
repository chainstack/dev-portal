<Info>
This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available on Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support them yet — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `eth_blockNumber` JSON-RPC method returns the number of the most recent block on the Hyperliquid EVM blockchain. This method is fundamental for tracking blockchain state, monitoring synchronization status, and implementing block-based logic in applications.

## Parameters

This method takes no parameters. The `params` field should be an empty array.

## Response

The method returns the current block number as a hexadecimal string.

### Response structure

**Block information:**
- `result` — The current block number as a hexadecimal string (e.g., "0x1b4" which equals 436 in decimal)

### Block number interpretation

**Hexadecimal format:**
- Block numbers are returned in hexadecimal format with "0x" prefix
- Convert to decimal for human-readable block height
- Example: "0x1b4" = 436 in decimal

**Usage patterns:**
- Track blockchain progression and new block creation
- Implement block-based polling and event detection
- Verify synchronization status with other nodes
- Calculate block intervals and timing

## Usage example

### Basic implementation

```javascript
// Get current block number
const getCurrentBlockNumber = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/YOUR_ENDPOINT/evm', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      method: 'eth_blockNumber',
      params: [],
      id: 1
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  const blockNumber = parseInt(data.result, 16);
  
  return {
    hex: data.result,
    decimal: blockNumber
  };
};

// Poll for new blocks
const pollForNewBlocks = async (callback) => {
  let lastBlockNumber = 0;
  
  const checkForNewBlock = async () => {
    try {
      const { decimal: currentBlock } = await getCurrentBlockNumber();
      
      if (currentBlock > lastBlockNumber) {
        lastBlockNumber = currentBlock;
        callback(currentBlock);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error checking block number:', error);
    }
  };
  
  // Poll every 2 seconds
  setInterval(checkForNewBlock, 2000);
};

// Usage
pollForNewBlocks((blockNumber) => {
  console.log(`New block: ${blockNumber}`);
});
```
