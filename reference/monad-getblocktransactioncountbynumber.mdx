## `eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber` code examples

<CodeGroup>
```javascript ethers.js
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL");

async function getBlockTransactionCount() {
  const blockNumber = "latest"; // Or use hex like "0x1234"
  const count = await provider.send("eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber", [blockNumber]);
  console.log(`Transaction count: ${parseInt(count, 16)}`);
}

getBlockTransactionCount();
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3

node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL"

web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url))
count = web3.eth.get_block_transaction_count('latest')
print(f'Transaction count: {count}')
```

## Use case

A practical use case for `eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber` is analyzing network throughput over time by sampling transaction counts across multiple blocks, which helps understand network congestion patterns.
