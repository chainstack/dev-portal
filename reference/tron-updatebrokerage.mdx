## Parameters

* `owner_address` — address of the witness account updating the brokerage. Use base58 with `visible: true`, or hex with `visible: false`.
* `brokerage` — new brokerage percentage (0–100); lower values share more rewards with voters.
* `visible` — optional boolean. When `true`, addresses are base58; when `false`, hex. Default is `true`.

## Response

* `visible` — boolean indicating whether addresses are in visible format
* `txID` — unique transaction ID for the brokerage update transaction
* `raw_data` — raw transaction data containing:
  * `contract` — array with brokerage update contract details
  * `ref_block_bytes` — reference block bytes for transaction validation
  * `ref_block_hash` — hash of the reference block
  * `expiration` — transaction expiration timestamp
  * `timestamp` — transaction creation timestamp
* `raw_data_hex` — complete transaction data encoded in hexadecimal format

## Use case

The `wallet/updatebrokerage` method is used for:

* Adjusting witness reward sharing policies to attract more voters.
* Setting competitive brokerage rates compared to other witnesses.
* Implementing dynamic reward sharing strategies based on market conditions.
* Managing witness economics to balance profitability and voter incentives.

<Warning>
Only registered witnesses can update their brokerage rate. The brokerage rate determines what percentage of block rewards the witness keeps (0-100%). A rate of 20% means the witness keeps 20% and shares 80% with voters. Changes may take effect after the next maintenance period.
</Warning>

## curl example

```shell Shell
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://tron-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/95e61622bf6a8af293978377718e3b77/wallet/updateBrokerage' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "owner_address": "THPvaUhoh2Qn2y9THCZML3H815hhFhn5YC",
  "brokerage": 15,
  "visible": true
}'
```

<Info>
common validation errors:

- `No permission` — the `owner_address` is not a registered witness.
- `Account […] does not exist` — ensure the address is activated and the format matches `visible`.
- Rate bounds — brokerage must be between 0 and 100.
 - `Not existed witness` — register the witness first via [`wallet/createwitness`](/reference/tron-createwitness) and wait until it is recognized on-chain.
