## Use case

The `info` endpoint with `type: "openOrders"` is essential for trading applications that need to:

* Display user's current open orders in a trading interface
* Calculate total order exposure and risk management
* Implement order management features (cancel, modify)
* Show pending orders across both perpetuals and spot markets
* Track order status and remaining unfilled quantities
* Build comprehensive trading dashboards
* Monitor liquidity provision through open limit orders
* Implement automated trading strategies that need order awareness

This endpoint is typically called frequently to keep trading interfaces updated with the current state of all pending orders, enabling users to manage their trading positions effectively.
