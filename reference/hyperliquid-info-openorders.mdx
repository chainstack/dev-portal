## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"openOrders"` to retrieve user's open orders.
* `user` (string, required) — Address in 42-character hexadecimal format (e.g., `0x31ca8395cf837de08b24da3f660e77761dfb974b`).
* `dex` (string, optional) — Perp dex name. Defaults to the empty string which represents the first perp dex. Spot open orders are only included with the first perp dex.

## Response

The response is an array of open order objects, each containing:

### Order fields

* `coin` (string) — Trading pair or asset symbol:
  * For perpetuals: Asset name (e.g., "BTC", "ETH")
  * For spot: Token symbol or index format (e.g., "PURR/USDC", "@107")
* `limitPx` (string) — Limit price of the order in string format for precision
* `oid` (integer) — Order ID, a unique identifier for the order
* `side` (string) — Order side:
  * `"A"` — Ask (sell order)
  * `"B"` — Bid (buy order)
* `sz` (string) — Remaining size of the order (unfilled amount)
* `timestamp` (integer) — Order creation timestamp in milliseconds

### Order side interpretation

* **"A" (Ask)**: Sell order - user wants to sell the asset at the specified price
* **"B" (Bid)**: Buy order - user wants to buy the asset at the specified price

### Asset naming conventions

* **Perpetuals**: Use simple asset names like "BTC", "ETH"
* **Spot**: Use either pair format like "PURR/USDC" or index format like "@107"

## Use case

The `info` endpoint with `type: "openOrders"` is essential for trading applications that need to:

* Display user's current open orders in a trading interface
* Calculate total order exposure and risk management
* Implement order management features (cancel, modify)
* Show pending orders across both perpetuals and spot markets
* Track order status and remaining unfilled quantities
* Build comprehensive trading dashboards
* Monitor liquidity provision through open limit orders
* Implement automated trading strategies that need order awareness

This endpoint is typically called frequently to keep trading interfaces updated with the current state of all pending orders, enabling users to manage their trading positions effectively.
