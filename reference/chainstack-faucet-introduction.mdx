The Chainstack Faucet API is a faucet API designed to facilitate the process of requesting testnet funds. By utilizing a simple API call with the Chainstack API key as authentication, users can effortlessly acquire the necessary testnet funds for their projects.

This faucet API integrates seamlessly with existing development workflows and prioritizes ease of use, making it an ideal solution for blockchain professionals focused on Ethereum-based projects. Adopt the Chainstack Faucet API for a streamlined approach to testnet fund acquisition and enhance your blockchain development experience.

## Faucet limitations

Due to the recent scarcity of testnet funds, the Chainstack Faucet API enforces stringent criteria for receiving testnet tokens.

<Info>
  To protect the faucet, a balance of at least 0.006 ETH on mainnet is required.

### Authentication

A Chainstack API key serves as the method of authentication.

### Amount limits

Test tokens are designed for development purposes rather than accumulation. To ensure fairness, users are restricted to receiving up to a limited amount of test tokens per day, as developers generally do not require large amounts for testing their DApps.

The Chainstack Faucet API adopts a "top-up" approach. If your wallet already contains the maximum amount of test tokens or more, you will be ineligible to receive additional tokens. However, if your wallet holds less than the maximum amount, the faucet will dispense the difference to top up your wallet balance.

### Frequency limits

The Chainstack Faucet API permits users to obtain test tokens once every 24 hours to maintain resource availability. If another request is submitted within this time frame, the API will return an error message specifying the time remaining before you become eligible for another request.
