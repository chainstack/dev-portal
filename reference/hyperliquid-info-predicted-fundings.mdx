### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"predictedFundings"` to retrieve predicted funding rates across exchanges.

## Response

The response returns an array where each element represents a trading asset and its funding predictions across different perpetual exchanges.

### Response structure

Each asset entry contains:

* **Asset symbol** (string) — The trading pair symbol (e.g., "BTC", "ETH", "SOL")
* **Exchange data array** — Contains funding information for each available exchange:
  * **Exchange name** — Platform identifier ("BinPerp", "HlPerp", "BybitPerp")
  * **Funding details object**:
    * `fundingRate` (string) — The predicted funding rate as a decimal string

### Exchange types

### Notes

* Funding rates are predictions and may change before the actual funding time
* Not all assets are available on all exchanges (indicated by `null` values)
* Funding intervals vary by exchange (typically 1, 2, 4, or 8 hours)
* Rates are expressed as decimal percentages (e.g., "0.0001" = 0.01%)
