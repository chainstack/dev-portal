Retrieving chain information from the Monad blockchain can be done by using the following methods:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="eth_chainId" icon="angle-right" iconType="solid" href="/reference/monad-getchainid" horizontal/>
  <Card title="eth_syncing" icon="angle-right" iconType="solid" href="/reference/monad-syncing" horizontal/>
</CardGroup>

This information can be used for:

* **Transaction signing** — ensure transactions are signed with the correct chain ID for replay protection.
* **Network identification** — verify the connected network (mainnet vs testnet).
* **Multi-chain applications** — correctly route transactions in applications supporting multiple networks.
