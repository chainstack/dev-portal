## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"tokenDetails"` to retrieve token details.
* `tokenId` (string, required) — The hexadecimal token identifier to query. This can be obtained from the `spotMetaAndAssetCtxs` endpoint.

## Response

The response returns a detailed object with comprehensive token information:

### Token Identity

* `name` (string) — Token symbol/ticker (e.g., "USDC", "PURR", "HYPE")

### Supply Metrics

* `maxSupply` (string) — Maximum possible token supply (may be unlimited)
* `totalSupply` (string) — Current total token supply in circulation
* `circulatingSupply` (string) — Current circulating supply available for trading
* `futureEmissions` (string) — Planned future token emissions

### Technical Specifications

* `szDecimals` (number) — Size decimals for trade sizing precision
* `weiDecimals` (number) — Wei decimals for on-chain representation

### Pricing Information

* `midPx` (string) — Current mid price from order book
* `markPx` (string) — Current mark price used for valuation
* `prevDayPx` (string) — Previous day's closing price

### Deployment Information

* `genesis` (object/null) — Genesis block information if applicable
* `deployer` (string/null) — Address of the token deployer
* `deployGas` (string/null) — Gas used for token deployment
* `deployTime` (number/null) — Unix timestamp of deployment

### Liquidity and Distribution

* `seededUsdc` (string) — USDC seeded for initial liquidity
* `nonCirculatingUserBalances` (array) — Non-circulating balances held by users

### Use Cases

**Token Analysis**
- Analyze token supply distribution and circulation metrics
- Monitor price performance and historical data
- Evaluate tokenomics and emission schedules

**Portfolio Management**
- Track detailed holdings and valuations
- Calculate market capitalizations using accurate supply data
- Monitor supply changes and dilution events

**Trading and Investment**
- Assess token liquidity through seeded USDC amounts
- Analyze price stability and volatility patterns
- Make informed trading decisions based on supply metrics

**Development and Integration**
- Configure applications with proper decimal handling
- Implement token-specific logic based on deployment details
- Build analytics dashboards with comprehensive token data

### Key Features

* **Complete supply breakdown** — Max, total, and circulating supply with future emissions
* **Real-time pricing** — Current mid and mark prices with historical reference
* **Deployment transparency** — Creator information and deployment metadata
* **Circulation analysis** — Detailed breakdown of non-circulating balances
* **Technical precision** — Exact decimal specifications for accurate calculations

### Notes

* Token IDs are unique hexadecimal identifiers obtained from market metadata
* Circulating supply may differ from total supply due to locked or vested tokens
* Mark prices are used for official valuations and may differ from mid prices
* Deployment information may be null for canonical or pre-existing tokens
* Future emissions indicate planned token releases that will increase total supply
* Non-circulating balances represent tokens held but not available for trading

### Finding Token IDs

To obtain token IDs for use with this endpoint:
1. Use the `spotMetaAndAssetCtxs` endpoint to get all token metadata
2. Extract the `tokenId` field from the desired token's metadata
3. Use that `tokenId` in this endpoint for detailed information
