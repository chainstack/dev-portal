The `getblock` method retrieves a block from the blockchain by its hash or height. If the verbosity parameter is omitted, the method returns a serialized block in hex format. If the verbosity parameter is set to 1, the method returns an Object with information about the block. If the verbosity parameter is set to 2, the method returns an Object with information about the block and information about each transaction.
