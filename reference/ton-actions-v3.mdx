# Actions

The `actions` endpoint retrieves decoded, human-readable actions from TON blockchain transactions. Actions represent high-level operations like Jetton transfers, NFT transfers, and TON transfers, parsed from raw transaction data.

<Note>
**TON pricing is the same for full, archive, v2, v3**

There's no difference between a full node an archive node in data availability or pricing.
All data is always available and all node requests are consumed as 1 request unit.

## Parameters

* `action_id` (string, optional) — Filter by specific action ID.
* `trace_id` (string, optional) — Get actions for a specific trace.
* `tx_hash` (string, optional) — Get actions for a specific transaction hash.
* `tx_lt` (integer, optional) — Filter by transaction logical time.
* `account` (string, optional) — Filter by account address.
* `action_type` (string, optional) — Filter by action type (e.g., `JettonTransfer`, `NftItemTransfer`, `TonTransfer`).
* `start_utime` (integer, optional) — Start of time range (unix timestamp).
* `end_utime` (integer, optional) — End of time range (unix timestamp).
* `limit` (integer, optional) — Maximum number of actions to return. Default: `10`.
* `offset` (integer, optional) — Number of actions to skip for pagination. Default: `0`.
* `sort` (string, optional) — Sort order: `asc` or `desc`. Default: `desc`.

## Response

* `actions` (array) — Array of action objects containing:
  * `action_id` (string) — Unique identifier for the action.
  * `trace_id` (string) — Trace ID this action belongs to.
  * `tx_hash` (string) — Hash of the transaction containing this action.
  * `type` (string) — Type of action (e.g., `JettonTransfer`, `NftItemTransfer`, `TonTransfer`, `ContractDeploy`).
  * `status` (string) — Action status (e.g., `ok`, `failed`).
  * `value` (object) — Action-specific data (varies by action type).
  * `start_lt` (integer) — Logical time when the action started.
  * `start_utime` (integer) — Unix timestamp when the action started.
  * `end_lt` (integer) — Logical time when the action ended.
  * `end_utime` (integer) — Unix timestamp when the action ended.

* `address_book` (object) — Address book mapping raw addresses to user-friendly information.

## Use case

The `actions` endpoint provides a higher-level view of blockchain activity than raw transactions:

1. Building user-friendly transaction histories showing "sent 100 USDT" instead of raw message data.
2. Filtering specific action types like all Jetton transfers for an account.
3. Creating analytics dashboards for token activity.
4. Implementing notification systems for specific action types.
5. Building portfolio trackers that understand different asset movements.

Here's an example of getting Jetton transfer actions:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  curl -X GET \
    'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v3/actions?action_type=JettonTransfer&limit=5' \
    -H 'accept: application/json'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Actions are decoded from traces, so they provide the same completeness as traces but in a more digestible format. Use actions for user-facing features and traces for deep debugging.
