<Warning>
All cryptographic parameters (`ask`, `alpha`, `tx_hash`) must be exactly 32 bytes (64 hexadecimal characters) provided as raw hex strings **without the 0x prefix**. Values that are shorter, longer, or include the 0x prefix will result in a "param length must be 32" error.
</Warning>

## Parameters

* `ask` — the authentication secret key used for signing (32 bytes, hex without 0x prefix)
* `alpha` — the alpha parameter for randomization (32 bytes, hex without 0x prefix)
* `tx_hash` — the transaction hash being authorized (32 bytes, hex without 0x prefix)

## Response

* `value` — the generated spending authorization signature (hex string without 0x prefix)

## Use case

The `wallet/createspendauthsig` method is used for:

* Authorizing the spending of shielded notes in privacy transactions
* Creating cryptographic signatures that prove spending authority without revealing identity
* Supporting the zero-knowledge proof system in shielded transactions
* Enabling secure authorization of shielded TRC20 transfers
