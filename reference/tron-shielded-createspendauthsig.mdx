## Parameters

* `ask` — the authentication secret key used for signing
* `alpha` — the alpha parameter for randomization  
* `tx_hash` — the transaction hash being authorized
* `sighash_type` — the signature hash type (typically SIGHASH_ALL)

## Response

* `signature` — the generated spending authorization signature
* `randomized_pk` — the randomized public key used in the signature

## Use case

The `wallet/createspendauthsig` method is used for:

* Authorizing the spending of shielded notes in privacy transactions
* Creating cryptographic signatures that prove spending authority without revealing identity
* Supporting the zero-knowledge proof system in shielded transactions
* Enabling secure authorization of shielded TRC20 transfers
