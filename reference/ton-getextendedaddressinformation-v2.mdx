## Parameters

* `address` (string, required) — The address for which extended information is being requested. Example: `EQDtFpEwcFAEcRe5mLVh2N6C0x-_hJEM7W61_JLnSF74p4q2`.
* `seqno` (int, optional) — the Masterchain seqno. You can get the Masterchain seqno with [getMasterchainInfo | TON v2](/reference/ton_node_api/v2/getMasterchainInfo).

Example with `seqno`:

```shell Shell
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v2/getExtendedAddressInformation?address=EQDtFpEwcFAEcRe5mLVh2N6C0x-_hJEM7W61_JLnSF74p4q2&seqno=45792554' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```


## JSON-RPC example

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v2/jsonRPC' \
