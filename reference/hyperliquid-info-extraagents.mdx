## Response

The response is an array of agent objects representing authorized accounts and their permissions:

### Agent identification

* `name` (string, optional) — Human-readable name or identifier for the agent
* `description` (string, optional) — Optional description of the agent's purpose or role

### Permission management

  * `"trade"` — Permission to execute trades on behalf of the user
  * `"withdraw"` — Permission to withdraw funds from the account

### Understanding agent management

**Agent types:**
- **Trading bots**: Automated trading systems with trade permissions
- **Management tools**: Applications with specific operational permissions
- **Backup accounts**: Secondary wallets with limited access rights
- **Service integrations**: Third-party services with delegated permissions

**Permission levels:**
- **Read-only**: Access to account information without modification rights
- **Trade-only**: Ability to execute trades but not withdraw funds
- **Full access**: Complete account management capabilities
- **Custom permissions**: Specific combinations of authorized actions

**Security considerations:**
- Agents provide controlled access without sharing private keys
- Permissions can be revoked or modified as needed
- Activity tracking enables audit trails for agent actions
