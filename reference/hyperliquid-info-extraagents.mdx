## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"extraAgents"` to retrieve extra agents associated with a user.
* `user` (string, required) — Address in 42-character hexadecimal format (e.g., `0x2ba553d9f990a3b66b03b2dc0d030dfc1c061036`).

## Response

The response is an array of agent objects:

### Agent identification

* `name` (string) — Human-readable label for the agent
* `address` (string) — Agent address in 42-character hexadecimal format
* `validUntil` (integer) — Timestamp in milliseconds until which the agent is valid

### Understanding agent management

**Agent types:**
- **Trading bots**: Automated trading systems with trade permissions
- **Management tools**: Applications with specific operational permissions
- **Backup accounts**: Secondary wallets with limited access rights
- **Service integrations**: Third-party services with delegated permissions

**Permission levels:**
- **Read-only**: Access to account information without modification rights
- **Trade-only**: Ability to execute trades but not withdraw funds
- **Full access**: Complete account management capabilities
- **Custom permissions**: Specific combinations of authorized actions

**Security considerations:**
- Agents provide controlled access without sharing private keys
- Permissions can be revoked or modified as needed
- Activity tracking enables audit trails for agent actions
