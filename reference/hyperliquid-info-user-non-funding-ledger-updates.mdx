<Info>
You can only use this endpoint on the official Hyperliquid public API. It is not available through Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support it yet. See [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `info` endpoint with `type: "userNonFundingLedgerUpdates"` retrieves comprehensive ledger updates for a specific user account on the Hyperliquid exchange, excluding funding payments. This endpoint provides detailed information about all account activities including deposits, withdrawals, transfers, liquidations, spot trading, and other balance-affecting operations.

<Info>
This endpoint is similar to [userFunding](/reference/hyperliquid-info-user-funding) — both query the Hyperliquid `info` API with different `type` values and return arrays of time‑ordered events. The difference is in scope: [userFunding](/reference/hyperliquid-info-user-funding) returns only funding events, whereas this page returns non‑funding ledger updates (deposits, withdrawals, transfers, liquidations, spot activity).

## Response

The response is an array of ledger update events, chronologically ordered from oldest to newest. Each event represents a balance-affecting operation on the user's account, excluding funding payments and receipts.

### Response structure

Each ledger update event contains:

**Event metadata:**
- `time` — Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the event occurred
- `hash` — Transaction hash for blockchain transactions

**Update details (`delta` object):**
- `type` — Type of ledger update (see transaction types below)
- Additional fields specific to each transaction type

### Transaction types

**Deposit operations:**
- `deposit` — USDC deposits into the account
  - `usdc` — Amount deposited in USDC

**Withdrawal operations:**
- `withdraw` — USDC withdrawals from the account
  - `usdc` — Amount withdrawn in USDC
  - `nonce` — Unique nonce for the withdrawal
  - `fee` — Withdrawal fee in USDC

**Account transfers:**
- `accountClassTransfer` — Transfers between spot and perpetual accounts
  - `usdc` — Amount transferred in USDC
  - `toPerp` — Boolean indicating transfer direction (true = to perp, false = to spot)

**Spot trading operations:**
- `spotTransfer` — Spot token transfers between accounts
  - `token` — Token symbol being transferred
  - `amount` — Token amount transferred
  - `usdcValue` — USD value of the transfer
  - `user` — Source user address
  - `destination` — Destination address
  - `fee` — Transfer fee
  - `nativeTokenFee` — Native token fee
  - `nonce` — Transfer nonce (if applicable)

- `spotGenesis` — Initial token allocations or airdrops
  - `token` — Token symbol
  - `amount` — Token amount received

**Sub-account operations:**
- `subAccountTransfer` — Transfers between main account and sub-accounts
  - `usdc` — Amount transferred
  - `user` — Source account address
  - `destination` — Destination account address

**Internal transfers:**
- `internalTransfer` — Internal transfers within the exchange
  - `usdc` — Amount transferred
  - `user` — Source user
  - `destination` — Destination user
  - `fee` — Transfer fee

**Liquidation events:**
- `liquidation` — Forced position closures due to insufficient margin
  - `liquidatedNtlPos` — Total notional value liquidated
  - `accountValue` — Account value at liquidation
  - `leverageType` — Leverage type (Cross/Isolated)
  - `liquidatedPositions` — Array of liquidated positions with coin and size

**Staking operations:**
- `cStakingTransfer` — Consensus staking deposits and withdrawals
  - `token` — Staked token symbol
  - `amount` — Amount staked/unstaked
  - `isDeposit` — Boolean indicating if it's a deposit or withdrawal

### Data interpretation

**Balance tracking:**

- USDC amounts can be positive (credits) or negative (debits)
- Events are sequential and can be used to reconstruct account history

**Transfer analysis:**
- `accountClassTransfer` events move funds between spot and perpetual trading
- `spotTransfer` events involve token movements between different addresses
- `subAccountTransfer` events manage funds across account hierarchies
