<Info>
You can only use this endpoint on the official Hyperliquid public API. It is not available through Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support it yet.
</Info>

The `info` endpoint with `type: "orderStatus"` retrieves the current status and details of a specific order on the Hyperliquid exchange. This endpoint accepts either an order ID (oid) or client order ID (cloid) to query order information, making it essential for order tracking and management.

## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"orderStatus"` to query order status.
* `user` (string, required) — Address in 42-character hexadecimal format; e.g. 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000.
* `oid` (integer or string, required) — Either u64 representing the order id or 16-byte hex string representing the client order id.

## Response

The response varies depending on whether the order is found or not:

### Successful order lookup

When an order is found, the response contains detailed order information:

**Response structure:**
- `status` — Always "order" when order information is available
- `order` — Object containing the order wrapper with order details and status

**Order wrapper structure:**
- `order` — Object containing the actual order details
- `status` — Current order status (see status values below)
- `statusTimestamp` — Timestamp when the status was last updated

**Order details (within the nested `order` object):**
- `coin` — Asset identifier (simple names like "BTC", "ETH" for perpetuals; spot format like "@107" for spot trades)
- `side` — Order side: "A" for Ask/Sell, "B" for Bid/Buy
- `limitPx` — Limit price as a string for precision
- `sz` — Current order size (remaining quantity)
- `oid` — Order ID
- `timestamp` — Order creation timestamp in milliseconds
- `triggerCondition` — Trigger condition for conditional orders
- `isTrigger` — Boolean indicating if this is a trigger order
- `triggerPx` — Trigger price for conditional orders
- `children` — Array of child orders (for TP/SL orders)
- `isPositionTpsl` — Boolean indicating if this is a position-level TP/SL order
- `reduceOnly` — Boolean indicating if this is a reduce-only order
- `orderType` — Order type (e.g., "Market", "Limit")
- `origSz` — Original order size
- `tif` — Time in force (e.g., "FrontendMarket", "Gtc", "Ioc")
- `cloid` — Client order ID if provided (null if not set)

### Order not found

When an order ID is not found:
- `status` — "unknownOid" indicating the order was not found

## Order status values

The `status` field in the order response can have the following values:

### Active states
- `open` — Order placed successfully and waiting for execution
- `triggered` — Trigger order has been triggered and converted to a regular order

### Completed states
- `filled` — Order has been completely executed

### Canceled states
- `canceled` — Order canceled by user
- `marginCanceled` — Canceled due to insufficient margin to fill
- `vaultWithdrawalCanceled` — Vaults only. Canceled due to user withdrawal from vault
- `openInterestCapCanceled` — Canceled due to order being too aggressive when open interest was at cap
- `selfTradeCanceled` — Canceled due to self-trade prevention
- `reduceOnlyCanceled` — Canceled reduce-only order that does not reduce position
- `siblingFilledCanceled` — TP/SL only. Canceled due to sibling order being filled
- `delistedCanceled` — Canceled due to asset delisting
- `liquidatedCanceled` — Canceled due to liquidation
- `scheduledCancel` — API only. Canceled due to exceeding scheduled cancel deadline (dead man's switch)

### Rejected states
- `rejected` — Order rejected at time of placement
- `tickRejected` — Rejected due to invalid tick price
- `minTradeNtlRejected` — Rejected due to order notional below minimum
- `perpMarginRejected` — Rejected due to insufficient margin
- `reduceOnlyRejected` — Rejected due to reduce only constraints
- `badAloPxRejected` — Rejected due to post-only immediate match
- `iocCancelRejected` — Rejected due to IOC not able to match
- `badTriggerPxRejected` — Rejected due to invalid TP/SL price
- `marketOrderNoLiquidityRejected` — Rejected due to lack of liquidity for market order
- `positionIncreaseAtOpenInterestCapRejected` — Rejected due to open interest cap
- `positionFlipAtOpenInterestCapRejected` — Rejected due to open interest cap
- `tooAggressiveAtOpenInterestCapRejected` — Rejected due to price too aggressive at open interest cap
- `openInterestIncreaseRejected` — Rejected due to open interest cap
- `insufficientSpotBalanceRejected` — Rejected due to insufficient spot balance
- `oracleRejected` — Rejected due to price too far from oracle
- `perpMaxPositionRejected` — Rejected due to exceeding margin tier limit at current leverage

## Order identification

### Order ID (oid)
- Numeric identifier assigned by the exchange
- Used as a 64-bit unsigned integer
- Automatically generated when orders are placed

### Client Order ID (cloid)
- Optional custom identifier provided by the client
- 16-byte hexadecimal string format
- Allows clients to track orders using their own identifiers
- Must be unique per user

## Asset identification

**Perpetual contracts:**
- Use simple asset names: "BTC", "ETH", "AVAX", "SOL"
- Represent standard perpetual futures contracts

**Spot markets:**
- Use indexed format: "@107", "@1", etc.
- Index corresponds to the spot pair position in the universe
- Some assets may have remapped names in user interfaces
