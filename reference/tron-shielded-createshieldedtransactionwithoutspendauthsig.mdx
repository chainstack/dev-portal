Create unsigned shielded TRX transactions. This endpoint is not exposed via RPC for security reasons—shielded transaction construction requires local key material and zero-knowledge proof generation. Build shielded transactions client-side using TRON shielded transaction libraries.

## Parameters

* `transparent_from_address` — the transparent TRX address sending funds (optional)
* `from_amount` — the amount to send from transparent address (in sun)
* `shielded_spends` — array of shielded input specifications
* `shielded_receives` — array of shielded output specifications
* `to_address` — recipient shielded address
* `to_amount` — amount to send to shielded address (in sun)

## Response

* `raw_data_hex` — the raw unsigned transaction data in hexadecimal format
* `raw_data` — the structured raw unsigned transaction data
* `txID` — the transaction ID hash (will change after signing)

## Use case

The `wallet/createshieldedtransactionwithoutspendauthsig` method is used for:

* Creating unsigned shielded transactions for offline signing workflows
* Separating transaction creation from signing for enhanced security
* Supporting hardware wallet integration with shielded transactions
* Enabling multi-step transaction creation processes

## Client-side implementation

<Info>
This endpoint is not available via RPC. Build shielded transactions client-side using TRON privacy libraries (e.g., tronweb with shielded support) or Sapling-compatible implementations. Generate the raw transaction locally with your key material, then sign and broadcast separately.
</Info>

Use TRON's shielded transaction libraries to:

1. Construct the shielded inputs (spends) and outputs (receives) using your local key material
2. Generate the zero-knowledge proof parameters offline
3. Build the raw transaction structure without spending authority signatures
4. Sign the transaction in a separate step (e.g., with hardware wallet)
5. Broadcast the signed transaction via `wallet/broadcasttransaction`
