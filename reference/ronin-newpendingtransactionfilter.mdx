Ronin API method that returns an array of log objects for all logs that have occurred since the last poll on the Ronin node. This method is used to retrieve event logs for a specific filter, which can be particularly useful for dApps that need to react to specific contract events.

## Parameters

* `filter_id` — a single filter identifier as a hexadecimal string. This filter ID is returned by `eth_newFilter` or `eth_newBlockFilter` and is used to poll for changes to the filter.

<Warning>
**Disclaimer**

Note that the default interactive example in this page will not work as the filter will be expired.

To test `eth_getFilterChanges` in this page, first create a new filter using one of the following:

* [eth\_newFilter](/reference/ronin-newfilter)
* [eth\_newPendingTransactionFilter](/reference/ronin-getfilterchanges)
* [eth\_newBlockFilter](/reference/ronin-newfilter)

Then use the fresh filter ID as the parameter for `eth_getFilterChanges`.
</Warning>


## Response

* `result` — an array of log objects. Each log object contains details about the event, including whether the log was removed (due to a chain reorganization), log index, transaction index, transaction hash, block hash, block number, address that generated the log, data associated with the log, and topics (event signatures and indexed event parameters).

## Use case

The `eth_getFilterChanges` method is essential for decentralized applications that need to monitor specific events on the blockchain. For example, a dApp might use this method to listen for token transfer events or contract interactions that trigger specific functionalities within the application.
