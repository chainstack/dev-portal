## Use case

The `signatureUnsubscribe` method is important for proper resource management in applications that use signature subscriptions. Common use cases include:

* Cleanup: Remove signature subscriptions after transaction confirmation
* Resource optimization: Free up resources by unsubscribing from completed transactions
* Connection management: Clean up subscriptions during WebSocket disconnections
* Transaction lifecycle: Automatically unsubscribe after receiving desired confirmation status

By properly managing signature subscriptions through unsubscribe calls, applications can maintain optimal performance and prevent unnecessary resource usage.
