## What is the Plasma protocol?

Plasma is an EVM-compatible blockchain built on Ethereum, designed to provide a high-performance, scalable platform for decentralized applications. Plasma utilizes Reth (Rust Ethereum) as its execution client, offering robust performance and reliability for developers building on the network.

## What is the Plasma API?

The Plasma API allows developers to communicate with the Plasma blockchain to build applications.

An application must connect to a Plasma RPC node to read data from and send transactions to the Plasma blockchain.

When communicating with a Plasma RPC node, the client implements a JSON-RPC specification, a communication protocol allowing one to make remote calls and execute them as if they were made locally.

## How to start using the Plasma API

You need access to a Plasma RPC node to use the Plasma API.

The Plasma mainnet RPC endpoint is available at:

```
https://plasma-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/be84184cd12967be5a65d06651c60085
```

Now, you can connect to the Plasma blockchain and use the Plasma API to build.

## Supported RPC methods

Plasma supports standard Ethereum JSON-RPC methods as well as debug and trace APIs:

* **Accounts info** — retrieve account balances, code, storage, and transaction counts
* **Blocks info** — access block data, headers, and transaction counts
* **Transaction info** — query transaction details and receipts
* **Execute transactions** — simulate and estimate gas for transactions
* **Gas data** — get current gas prices and fee history
* **Chain info** — access chain ID, sync status, and protocol version
* **Filter handling** — create and manage event filters
* **Logs and events** — query blockchain logs
* **Client info** — get client version and network information
* **Debug and trace** — access advanced debugging and tracing capabilities
