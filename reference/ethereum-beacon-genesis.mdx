## Parameters

* `none`

## Response

* `object` — genesis information.

  * `genesis_time` — the UNIX timestamp of when the Beacon Chain's genesis event occurred. This is important because it marks the starting point of the Ethereum Beacon Chain network.
  * `genesis_validators_root` — the Merkle root of the initial set of validators at the time of the genesis event. Validators are participants in the PoS system that propose and attest to new blocks.
  * `genesis_fork_version` — the fork version of the Ethereum protocol active during the genesis event. This helps clients understand the version of the network they are interacting with.
