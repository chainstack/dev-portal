description: "Pathfinder 0.19.0 changes the default Starknet JSON-RPC API at the root endpoint from v0.7.1 to v0.8.0. Learn how to verify and migrate safely."
---

<Warning>
  **Breaking change notice**

  With the roll-out of Pathfinder node version [0.19.0](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.19.0), the default version of the JSON-RPC API served on the `/` path has changed to 0.8.0. Previously, the Starknet spec version served on the default endpoint was 0.7.1.
</Warning>

This change affects how you interact with Starknet through the Pathfinder node if you're using the default endpoint without specifying a specific API version.

## What changed

The default JSON-RPC API version served on the root (`/`) endpoint has been updated:
- **Before upgrade**: Default endpoint served JSON-RPC API version 0.7.1
- **After upgrade**: Default endpoint now serves JSON-RPC API version 0.8.0

## Checking the current API version

You can verify which JSON-RPC API version is being served on your endpoint using the `starknet_specVersion` method:

```bash
curl -X POST CHAINSTACK_STARKNET_PATHFINDER_ENDPOINT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "starknet_specVersion",
    "params": [],
    "id": 1
  }'
```

## Accessing different API versions

Different JSON-RPC API spec versions are served over specific endpoints. You can access them by appending the version path to your Chainstack Starknet Pathfinder endpoint:

- **Version 0.7**: `CHAINSTACK_STARKNET_PATHFINDER_ENDPOINT/rpc/v0_7`
- **Version 0.8**: `CHAINSTACK_STARKNET_PATHFINDER_ENDPOINT/rpc/v0_8`
- **Version 0.9**: `CHAINSTACK_STARKNET_PATHFINDER_ENDPOINT/rpc/v0_9`

## Migration guide

### Continuing to use version 0.7.1

If your application requires the previous JSON-RPC API version 0.7.1, you can still access it by explicitly specifying the version in your endpoint URL:

**Before (using default endpoint):**
```bash
curl -X POST CHAINSTACK_STARKNET_PATHFINDER_ENDPOINT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "starknet_getBlockWithTxHashes",
    "params": {"block_id": "latest"},
    "id": 1
  }'
```

**After (explicitly using v0.7):**
```bash
curl -X POST CHAINSTACK_STARKNET_PATHFINDER_ENDPOINT/rpc/v0_7 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "starknet_getBlockWithTxHashes",
    "params": {"block_id": "latest"},
    "id": 1
  }'
```

### Using the new default (v0.8)

If you want to use the new default version 0.8.0, you can either:
1. Continue using the default endpoint (`/`) which now serves v0.8
2. Explicitly specify `/rpc/v0_8` for clarity

## Version differences

To understand the differences between the JSON-RPC API versions and what changes you might need to make to your application, refer to the official Starknet specifications:

- [Starknet Specs Releases](https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-specs/releases) - Complete changelog and differences between spec versions

## Best practices

1. **Always specify the API version explicitly** in production applications to avoid unexpected changes when defaults are updated
2. **Test your application** with the new API version before migrating
3. **Review the specification changes** to understand new features and breaking changes between versions
