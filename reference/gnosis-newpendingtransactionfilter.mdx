Gnosis Chain API method that creates a filter that listens for new pending transactions on the blockchain. It returns a filter ID, which can be used to retrieve the results using the [eth\_getFilterChanges](/reference/gnosis-getfilterchanges) method. The `eth_newBlockFilter` method is useful for developers who must be notified of new blocks on the blockchain in real time.

## Parameters

* `none`

## Response

* `result` â€” a hexadecimal string representing the ID of the newly created filter

## Code examples

<Warning>
The filters created are stored on the blockchain client instance. The filter is automatically deleted if not polled within a certain time (5 minutes by default).
</Warning>


Use the following methods with the filter ID:

* [eth\_getFilterChanges](/reference/gnosis-getfilterchanges) to retrieve updates
* [eth\_uninstallFilter](/reference/gnosis-uninstallfilter) to remove the filter

## `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter` code examples

<Note>
Note that the `web3.eth.filter` methods have been deprecated and replaced with the `web3.eth.subscribe` in web3.js. See [web3.js subscriptions](/reference/gnosis-web3js-subscriptions-methods).

```javascript ethers.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);

const createFilter = async () => {
  try {
    const filterId = await provider.send('eth_newPendingTransactionFilter', []);
    console.log(filterId); // the filter ID returned by eth_newFilter
    return filterId
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};

createFilter();
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3  
node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL" 
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url))

def get_new_pending_transactions():
    try:
        blocks_filter = web3.eth.filter('pending')

        # Split the string at the space character
        parts = str(blocks_filter).split(' ')

        # Extract the filter value from the second part
        filter_id = parts[2]

        return filter_id
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

new_filter = get_new_pending_transactions()
print(new_filter)
```

## Use case

One way to use the `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter` method is to listen for new pending transactions at predefined intervals and extract specific data from them. For instance, a decentralized application might check for pending transactions every second and identify those that transfer a value greater than a certain amount of the ETH token. This could be useful for monitoring high-value transactions or detecting potential fraud or security threats in real time.

Here is an implementation of this concept using ethers.js:

```javascript index.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);

// Create a filter using eth_newPendingTransactionFilter
const createFilter = async () => {
  try {
    const filterId = await provider.send('eth_newPendingTransactionFilter', []);
    console.log(filterId); // the filter ID returned by eth_newFilter
    return filterId
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};

// Use the filter to extract the value from each transaction
async function getValue(filter) {
  try {
    // Retrieve the list of new pending transactions
    const transactions = await provider.send('eth_getFilterChanges', [filter]);

    // Loop through the list of transactions and process each one
    for (const hash of transactions) {

      const receipt = await provider.send("eth_getTransactionByHash", [hash]);

      // Check that the receipt is not null and has a non-null value field
      if (receipt && receipt.value != null) {
        const value = receipt.value;
        const decimalValue = BigInt(value).toString();
        const convertedValue = ethers.utils.formatEther(decimalValue);
        
        // Check if the transferred value is greater than or equal to 100 ETH
        if (convertedValue >= 100) {
          console.log(`This transaction is sending more than 100 ETH`);
          console.log(`Transaction Hash: ${hash}`);
          console.log(`Value transferred: ${convertedValue} \n`);
        }
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error); // Handle errors that may occur
  }
}

// Main program setting an interval to call the `getValue` function at regular intervals
async function main() {

const filterId =  await createFilter();
setInterval(getValue, 1000, filterId);

}

main()
```


This code sets up an Gnosis Chain filter to listen for new pending transactions and extract specific data from them.

The code consists of three functions: `createFilter`, `getValue`, and `main`. Here's an overview of how each function works:

The `createFilter` function sets up a new filter using the `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter` method. It returns the ID of the filter, which can be used to retrieve data from the filter later.

The `getValue` function retrieves the list of new pending transactions using the [eth\_getFilterChanges](/reference/gnosis-getfilterchanges) method and loops through each transaction. For each transaction, it retrieves the transaction data using the [eth\_getTransactionByHash](/reference/gnosis-gettransactionbyhash) method and checks if the transaction value is greater than or equal to 100 ETH. If the value is above this threshold, the function logs information about the transaction to the console.

The `main` function sets up the program by first calling the `createFilter` function to create a new filter and retrieve its ID. It then sets an interval to call the `getValue` function every 1 second, passing the filter ID as an argument to retrieve the latest transaction data at regular intervals.
