## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"spotMeta"` to retrieve spot metadata.

## Response

The response contains two main sections:

### Tokens

An array of spot tokens with their metadata:

* `name` (string) — The token name (e.g., "USDC", "PURR").
* `szDecimals` (integer) — Number of decimal places for size precision.
* `weiDecimals` (integer) — Number of decimal places for wei representation.
* `index` (integer) — Unique token index identifier.
* `tokenId` (string) — Unique token identifier in hexadecimal format.
* `isCanonical` (boolean) — Whether the token is canonical on the platform.
* `evmContract` (object, nullable) — EVM contract data if applicable: `address` (string), `evm_extra_wei_decimals` (integer).
* `fullName` (string, nullable) — Full descriptive name of the token.
* `deployerTradingFeeShare` (string, optional) — Deployer trading fee share for this token.

### Universe

An array of spot trading pairs:

* `name` (string) — Trading pair name (e.g., "PURR/USDC", "@1").
* `tokens` (array) — Array of token indices that make up the trading pair.
* `index` (integer) — Unique pair index identifier.
* `isCanonical` (boolean) — Whether the trading pair is canonical.

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "spotMeta"}' \
  https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/4f8d8f4040bdacd1577bff8058438274/info
```

## Use case

The `info` endpoint with `type: "spotMeta"` is essential for spot trading applications that need to:

* Display available spot tokens and their specifications
* Validate trading pair configurations
* Map token indices to human-readable names
* Understand decimal precision for accurate calculations
* Identify canonical vs non-canonical tokens and pairs
* Build trading interfaces with proper token and pair data

This metadata is typically cached and used throughout the application to ensure accurate token handling and trading pair validation for spot trading on Hyperliquid.
