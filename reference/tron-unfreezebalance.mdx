TRON API method that unstakes TRX previously frozen for bandwidth or energy resources (deprecated method). This method releases TRX tokens that were previously frozen, making them available for transfer after the lock period expires. Note that this is the legacy unstaking mechanism, replaced by `unfreezebalancev2`.

The `wallet/unfreezebalance` method is used for:

* Unstaking TRX to make tokens transferable again (legacy method).

* Supporting older applications that still use the original unstaking mechanism.
* Migrating from the deprecated unstaking system to the new `unfreezebalancev2` method.
