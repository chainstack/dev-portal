Subscribe to the Beacon Chain events and receive a stream of the following data:

* **Event type** (event: `head`): This specifies the type of event being streamed. In this case, it's a head event, which relates to the latest confirmed block on the Beacon Chain.
* **Data fields**:
  + `slot`: The slot number at which this block was proposed. Slots are time periods during which a block can be proposed.
  + `block`: The hash of the block that has been accepted as the head of the chain.
  + `state`: The state root of the Ethereum network after processing this block.
  + `epoch_transition`: A boolean indicating whether or not this block involved a transition between epochs.
  + `previous_duty_dependent_root` and `current_duty_dependent_root`: These roots help in understanding the duties thatvalidators need to perform, which may vary from one epoch to another.
  + `execution_optimistic`: A boolean indicating the execution mode. If false, it means the block is fully validated; if true, it implies the block is processed in an optimistic mode, where certain validations might be pending.
