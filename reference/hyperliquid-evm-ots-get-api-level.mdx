<Info>
This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `ots_getApiLevel` JSON-RPC method returns the Otterscan API version level supported by the Hyperliquid EVM node. This method allows clients, particularly the Otterscan block explorer, to determine which API features are available on the connected node.

## Parameters

This method accepts no parameters.

## Response

The method returns an integer representing the API level version.

### Response structure

- `result` — the API level number (e.g., 8 for the current version)

## Usage example

```shell Shell
curl -X POST https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/4f8d8f4040bdacd1577bff8058438274/evm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "ots_getApiLevel",
    "params": [],
    "id": 1
  }'
```

### Example response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": 8
}
```

## API level features

Different API levels indicate support for various Otterscan features:

### Level 8 (Current)
- Full Otterscan API support including:
  - Block and transaction tracing
  - Internal operations tracking
  - Contract creator identification
  - Transaction error retrieval
  - Paginated queries
  - Address transaction history

### Version compatibility
- Otterscan uses this method to:
  - Verify node compatibility
  - Enable/disable features based on API level
  - Provide appropriate fallbacks for missing features

## Use cases

The `ots_getApiLevel` method is essential for:

* **Compatibility checking**: Verify if a node supports required Otterscan features
* **Feature detection**: Enable or disable UI features based on available APIs
* **Version negotiation**: Ensure client-server compatibility
* **Graceful degradation**: Provide fallback functionality for older API versions
* **Development testing**: Verify API implementation completeness
* **Node validation**: Confirm nodes are running with Otterscan support
* **Explorer configuration**: Auto-configure block explorer features
* **API documentation**: Determine which methods are available
* **Integration testing**: Validate node setup for Otterscan compatibility
* **Monitoring tools**: Check API availability across multiple nodes

This method is typically the first call made by Otterscan to establish what features can be used with the connected node.
