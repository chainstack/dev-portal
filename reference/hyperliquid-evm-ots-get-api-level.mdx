## Parameters

This method accepts no parameters.

## Response

The method returns an integer representing the API level version.

### Response structure

- `result` â€” the API level number (e.g., 8 for the current version)

## Usage example

```shell Shell
curl -X POST https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/4f8d8f4040bdacd1577bff8058438274/evm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "ots_getApiLevel",
    "params": [],
    "id": 1
  }'
```

### Example response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": 8
}
```

## API level features

Different API levels indicate support for various Otterscan features:

### Level 8 (Current)
- Full Otterscan API support including:
  - Block and transaction tracing
  - Internal operations tracking
  - Contract creator identification
  - Transaction error retrieval
  - Paginated queries
  - Address transaction history

### Version compatibility
- Otterscan uses this method to:
  - Verify node compatibility
  - Enable/disable features based on API level
  - Provide appropriate fallbacks for missing features

## Use cases

The `ots_getApiLevel` method is essential for:

* **Compatibility checking**: Verify if a node supports required Otterscan features
* **Feature detection**: Enable or disable UI features based on available APIs
* **Version negotiation**: Ensure client-server compatibility
* **Graceful degradation**: Provide fallback functionality for older API versions
* **Development testing**: Verify API implementation completeness
* **Node validation**: Confirm nodes are running with Otterscan support
* **Explorer configuration**: Auto-configure block explorer features
* **API documentation**: Determine which methods are available
* **Integration testing**: Validate node setup for Otterscan compatibility
* **Monitoring tools**: Check API availability across multiple nodes

This method is typically the first call made by Otterscan to establish what features can be used with the connected node.
