Base API method `eth_sendRawTransactionSync` allows for the submission of a pre-signed transaction to the Base network and waits synchronously for the transaction receipt or a configurable timeout. This method reduces transaction submission latency by combining transaction submission and receipt retrieval into a single RPC call, based on [EIP-7966](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7966).

## Parameters

* `signedTransactionData` — the signed transaction data in hexadecimal format. This data includes the transaction details such as nonce, gas price, gas limit, to address, value, data, and the signature.
* `timeout` (optional) — maximum wait time in milliseconds. If not provided, uses the node's default timeout (typically 2 seconds). Must be a positive integer within the node-configured maximum timeout.

## Response

* `result` — the complete transaction receipt object containing transaction hash, block information, gas usage, contract address (if applicable), logs, and status.

## Use case

The `eth_sendRawTransactionSync` method is particularly useful for:

* High-frequency applications requiring immediate transaction confirmation feedback.
* Layer 2 solutions with fast block times where rapid transaction throughput is critical.
* DApps and wallets seeking to improve user experience with faster transaction confirmations.
* Trading applications where transaction latency directly impacts performance.
* Applications requiring stronger delivery guarantees than standard asynchronous transaction submission.
