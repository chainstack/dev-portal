title: eth_getCode | Cronos
openapi: /openapi/cronos_node_api/eth_getCode.json POST /b9b0fb92029d58b396139a9e89cf479b
---

Cronos API method that retrieves the compiled bytecode of a smart contract, providing its address as a parameter. This method returns a hexadecimal string representing the smart contract's bytecode.

Developers can use this bytecode to verify whether a smart contract is legitimate and ensure that it performs its intended functions.

## Parameters

* `address` — the address of the smart contract to query.
* `quantity or tag` — the integer of a block encoded as hexadecimal or the string with:

  + `latest` — the most recent block in the blockchain and the current state of the blockchain at the most recent block. A chain reorganization is to be expected.
  + `safe` — the block that received justification from the beacon chain. Although this block could be involved in a chain reorganization, it would necessitate either a coordinated attack by the majority of validators or an instance of severe propagation latency.
  + `finalized` — the block accepted as canonical by more than 2/3 of the validators. A chain reorganization is extremely unlikely, and it would require at least 1/3 of the staked amount to be burned.
  + `earliest` — the earliest available or genesis block.
  + `pending` — the pending state and transactions block. The current state of transactions that have been broadcast to the network but have not yet been included in a block.

<Note>
See the [default block parameter](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block) and [How The Merge Impacts Ethereum’s Application Layer](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer).
</Note>


## Response

`data` — the compiled bytecode of a smart contract. Returns `0x` if the address is not associated with a smart contract.

## `eth_getCode` code examples

The following example retrieves the compiled bytecode from the [WCRO token smart contract](https://cronoscan.com/token/0x5c7f8a570d578ed84e63fdfa7b1ee72deae1ae23).

```javascript web3.js
const { Web3 } = require("web3");
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

async function getCode(address, block) {
  const code = await web3.eth.getCode(address, block)
  console.log(code)
 }
 
 getCode("0x5C7F8A570d578ED84E63fdFA7b1eE72dEae1AE23", "latest" )
```

```javascript ethers.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);

const getCode = async (address, block) => {
    const code = await provider.send("eth_getCode", [address, block]);
    console.log(code);
  };

  getCode("0x5C7F8A570d578ED84E63fdFA7b1eE72dEae1AE23", "latest")
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3  
node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL" 

code = web3.eth.get_code("0x5C7F8A570d578ED84E63fdFA7b1eE72dEae1AE23", "latest") 
print(web3.to_hex(code))   # Convert the Bytes result into HEX.
```
</CodeGroup>


## Use case

A practical use case for the `eth_getcode` method is verifying whether an address is associated with a smart contract. This can be particularly useful for blockchain explorers, auditors, and DApp developers, who must ensure that the account they interact with is legitimate.
