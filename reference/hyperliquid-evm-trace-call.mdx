<Info>
This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `trace_call` JSON-RPC method executes a call and returns trace information using OpenEthereum-style tracing. This method simulates a transaction and provides detailed execution traces without committing changes to the blockchain, making it ideal for transaction analysis, debugging, and testing before actual execution.

## Parameters

1. **Call object** (object, required): Transaction call details
2. **Trace types** (array, required): Array of trace types to include
3. **Block parameter** (string, required): Block number, hash, or "latest"/"earliest"/"pending"

### Call object structure

- `from` (string, optional): Address the transaction is sent from
- `to` (string, required): Address the transaction is directed to
- `gas` (string, optional): Gas provided for transaction execution
- `gasPrice` (string, optional): Gas price for the transaction
- `value` (string, optional): Value sent with the transaction
- `data` (string, optional): Hash of the method signature and encoded parameters

### Trace types

- `"trace"`: Basic execution trace information
- `"vmTrace"`: Virtual machine execution trace
- `"stateDiff"`: State differences caused by the transaction

## Response

The method returns an array of trace objects containing detailed execution information.

### Response structure

**Trace objects:**
- `action` — Details about the call action (from, to, value, gas, input, callType)
- `result` — Execution result (gasUsed, output)
- `traceAddress` — Address path within the call hierarchy
- `type` — Type of trace (call, create, suicide, etc.)

## Usage example

### Basic implementation

```javascript
// Execute a traced call
const traceCall = async (callObject, traceTypes = ['trace'], blockParam = 'latest') => {
  const response = await fetch('https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/YOUR_ENDPOINT/evm', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      method: 'trace_call',
      params: [callObject, traceTypes, blockParam],
      id: 1
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.result;
};

// Analyze contract interaction
const analyzeContractCall = async () => {
  const callObject = {
    from: '0x69835D480110e4919B7899f465aAB101e21c8A87',
    to: '0xB7C609cFfa0e47DB2467ea03fF3e598bf59361A5',
    gas: '0x76c0',
    gasPrice: '0x9184e72a000',
    value: '0xde0b6b3a7640000',
    data: '0x'
  };

  const traces = await traceCall(callObject);
  
  console.log('Execution Trace Analysis:');
  traces.forEach((trace, index) => {
    console.log(`Trace ${index + 1}:`);
    console.log(`  Type: ${trace.type}`);
    console.log(`  From: ${trace.action.from}`);
    console.log(`  To: ${trace.action.to}`);
    console.log(`  Gas Used: ${parseInt(trace.result.gasUsed, 16)}`);
    console.log(`  Call Type: ${trace.action.callType}`);
  });
  
  return traces;
};

// Usage
analyzeContractCall().then(traces => {
  console.log('Analysis completed');
});
```
