# Pending Traces

The `pendingTraces` endpoint retrieves traces that are pending completion in the TON blockchain. These represent transaction execution flows that have not yet fully propagated through all necessary contracts.

<Note>
**TON pricing is the same for full, archive, v2, v3**

There's no difference between a full node an archive node in data availability or pricing.
All data is always available and all node requests are consumed as 1 request unit.

## Parameters

* `trace_id` (string, optional) — Filter by specific trace ID.
* `limit` (integer, optional) — Maximum number of traces to return. Default: `10`.
* `offset` (integer, optional) — Number of traces to skip for pagination. Default: `0`.

## Response

* `traces` (array) — Array of pending trace objects:
  * `trace_id` (string) — Trace ID.
  * `external_hash` (string) — Hash of the external message.
  * `mc_seqno_start` (integer) — Start masterchain sequence number.
  * `start_lt` (integer) — Start logical time.
  * `start_utime` (integer) — Start unix timestamp.
  * `state` (string) — Trace state (e.g., `pending`).
  * `pending_edges` (integer) — Number of pending message edges.
  * `edges` (integer) — Total edges so far.
  * `nodes` (integer) — Total nodes so far.

* `address_book` (object) — Address book mapping.

## Use case

The `pendingTraces` endpoint is essential for tracking in-progress complex operations:

1. Monitoring multi-hop transactions that involve several contracts.
2. Tracking Jetton transfers waiting for completion across wallet contracts.
3. Debugging stuck transactions by identifying pending message edges.
4. Building real-time dashboards showing transaction progress.
5. Implementing timeout alerts for transactions taking too long.

Here's an example of getting pending traces:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  curl -X GET \
    'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v3/pendingTraces?limit=5' \
    -H 'accept: application/json'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  The `pending_edges` field indicates how many messages are still being processed. A trace completes when this reaches zero.
