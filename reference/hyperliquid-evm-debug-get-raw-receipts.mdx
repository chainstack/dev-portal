<Info>
This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available on Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support them yet — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `debug_getRawReceipts` JSON-RPC method returns the raw receipt data for all transactions in a specific block. This method provides complete receipt information in raw encoded format for all transactions in a block, useful for bulk receipt processing and low-level blockchain analysis.

## Parameters

1. **Block identifier** (string, required): Block number, hash, or "latest"/"earliest"/"pending"

## Response

The method returns an array of raw receipt data for all transactions in the specified block.

### Response structure

**Raw receipts array:**
- `result` — Array of raw receipt data, one for each transaction in the block

## Usage example

### Basic implementation

```javascript
// Get raw receipts for all transactions in a block
const getRawReceipts = async (blockIdentifier = 'latest') => {
  const response = await fetch('https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/YOUR_ENDPOINT/evm', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      method: 'debug_getRawReceipts',
      params: [blockIdentifier],
      id: 1
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.result;
};

// Usage
getRawReceipts('latest').then(receipts => {
  console.log(`Found ${receipts.length} receipts in block`);
  receipts.forEach((receipt, index) => {
    console.log(`Receipt ${index + 1} size: ${receipt.length / 2 - 1} bytes`);
  });
});
```

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "debug_getRawReceipts",
    "params": [
      "latest"
    ],
    "id": 1
  }' \
