## Parameters

1. **block hash** (string, required): The hash of the block to retrieve details for

## Response

The method returns an enhanced block object with additional calculated fields.

### Response structure

- `block` — standard block object with all transactions
  - `number` — the block number
  - `hash` — the block hash
  - `parentHash` — the parent block hash
  - `timestamp` — Unix timestamp of the block
  - `gasLimit` — maximum gas allowed in the block
  - `gasUsed` — total gas used by all transactions
  - `miner` — address that mined/validated the block
  - `baseFeePerGas` — base fee per gas (post-EIP-1559)
  - `transactions` — array of transaction objects
  - `transactionCount` — number of transactions in the block
- `issuance` — block reward issuance information
  - `blockReward` — reward for mining the block
  - `uncleReward` — rewards for uncle blocks
  - `issuance` — total new ETH issued
- `totalFees` — total transaction fees collected in the block (in wei)

## Use cases

The `ots_getBlockDetailsByHash` method is essential for:

* **Block explorers**: Display comprehensive block information when accessed by hash
* **Block verification**: Retrieve detailed information for specific known blocks
* **Cross-reference validation**: Verify block data using hash identifiers
* **Fee reconciliation**: Calculate total fees for specific blocks
* **Fork detection**: Analyze blocks on different chain branches
* **Archive queries**: Access historical block data by hash
* **Integration testing**: Verify specific blocks in test scenarios
* **Audit trails**: Reference specific blocks in compliance reports
* **Performance benchmarking**: Analyze specific blocks for metrics
* **Research tools**: Study particular blocks of interest

This method is particularly useful when you have a block hash from an event log or transaction receipt and need to retrieve comprehensive block information.
