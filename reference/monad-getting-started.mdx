## What is the Monad protocol?

Monad is a high-performance EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain designed for massive scalability. It achieves up to 10,000 transactions per second with 1-second block times and near-instant finality through innovations like parallel execution, optimistic concurrency, and the MonadBFT consensus mechanism. Monad is fully compatible with existing Ethereum tooling at the bytecode level, so Solidity contracts, developer tools, and libraries work without modification.

Find useful Monad tools in the [Monad tooling](/docs/monad-tooling) section.

## What is the Monad API?

The Monad API allows developers to communicate with the Monad blockchain to build applications.

Since Monad is EVM-compatible, it uses the standard Ethereum JSON-RPC API. An application must connect to a Monad RPC node to read data from and send transactions to the Monad blockchain.

When communicating with a Monad RPC node, the client implements a JSON-RPC specification, a communication protocol allowing one to make remote calls and execute them as if they were made locally.

## How to start using the Monad API

You need access to a Monad RPC node to use the Monad API.

Follow these steps to sign up on Chainstack, deploy a Monad RPC node, and find your endpoint credentials:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    [Sign up with Chainstack](https://console.chainstack.com/user/account/create).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    [Deploy a node](/docs/manage-your-networks#join-a-public-network).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    [View node access and credentials](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).
  </Step>
</Steps>

Now, you can connect to the Monad blockchain and use the Monad API to build.
