<Note>
This endpoint requires signature authentication. See our comprehensive [Authentication via Signatures guide](/docs/hyperliquid-authentication-guide) for implementation details.
</Note>

Cancels one or multiple open orders by client order ID (cloid) on the Hyperliquid exchange. This is useful when you want to cancel orders using your own tracking IDs rather than the exchange-generated order IDs.

## Parameters

### Required parameters

* `action` (object, required) — The cancel action object containing:
  * `type` (string) — Must be `"cancelByCloid"`
  * `cancels` (array) — Array of cancel objects with:
    * `asset` (number) — Asset index
    * `cloid` (string) — Client order ID (128-bit hex string, e.g., `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef`)

* `nonce` (number, required) — Current timestamp in milliseconds (must be recent)
* `signature` (object, required) — EIP-712 signature of the action

### Optional parameters

* `vaultAddress` (string, optional) — Address when trading on behalf of a vault or subaccount

* `response` — Contains cancellation details:
  * `type` — `"cancelByCloid"`
  * `data.statuses` — Array of status results for each cancellation attempt

## Example request

<CodeGroup>

```shell cURL
curl -X POST https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/exchange \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": {
      "type": "cancelByCloid",
      "cancels": [{
        "asset": 0,
        "cloid": "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
      }]
    },
    "nonce": 1234567890123,
    "signature": {...}
  }'
```

```python Python
from hyperliquid.exchange import Exchange
from hyperliquid.utils import constants
import eth_account

# Initialize with your private key
account = eth_account.Account.from_key("0x...")
exchange = Exchange(account, constants.MAINNET_API_URL)

# Cancel an order by client order ID
cancel_result = exchange.cancel_by_cloid(
    coin="BTC",
    cloid="0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
)

print(cancel_result)
```

## Client Order ID (cloid)

The client order ID is a 128-bit hexadecimal string that you provide when placing an order. It allows you to:

* Track orders using your own identification system
* Cancel orders without needing to store exchange-generated order IDs
* Implement idempotent order placement strategies

Example cloid format: `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef`

## Use cases

* **Custom order tracking** — Cancel orders using your internal order management system IDs
* **Failover systems** — Cancel orders without needing to query order IDs first
* **Multi-system integration** — Use consistent order IDs across different systems
* **Idempotent operations** — Safely retry cancellations using deterministic IDs

<Note>
Client order IDs must be unique per user. Attempting to place an order with a duplicate cloid will be rejected.
</Note>

<Warning>
Make sure to store the cloid when placing orders if you plan to use this cancellation method. The cloid must match exactly what was provided during order placement.
</Warning>
