## Parameters

* `address` — hexadecimal address of the witness whose brokerage rate you want to query

## Response

* `brokerage` — the current brokerage percentage (0-100) set by the witness for reward sharing

## Use case

The `wallet/getbrokerage` method is used for:

* Checking the current reward sharing rate of a witness before voting.
* Comparing brokerage rates between different witnesses to maximize voting rewards.
* Monitoring changes in witness brokerage policies over time.
* Building witness comparison tools and voting recommendation systems.

<Note>
Brokerage rates can range from 0% to 100%. A rate of 20% means the witness keeps 20% of block rewards and distributes 80% to their voters. Lower brokerage rates generally mean higher rewards for voters.
