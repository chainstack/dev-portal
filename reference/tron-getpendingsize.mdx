This method requires no parameters. It returns the current size of the pending transaction pool.

## Response

* `pendingSize` â€” number representing the current count of pending transactions in the mempool

## Use case

The `wallet/getpendingsize` method is used for:

* Monitoring network congestion by tracking the number of pending transactions.
* Building network analytics dashboards that display mempool statistics.
* Implementing adaptive fee strategies based on current network load.
* Creating alerts for high network congestion periods.
* Optimizing transaction timing for applications based on mempool size.

<Note>
The pending pool size fluctuates constantly as new transactions are submitted and existing ones are confirmed or dropped. A larger pending size typically indicates higher network congestion and may suggest longer confirmation times.
