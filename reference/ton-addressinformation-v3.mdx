* `address` (string, required) — The account address to query.

## Response

* `balance` (string) — Account balance in nanotons.
* `code` (string) — Smart contract code in base64 format.
* `data` (string) — Smart contract data in base64 format.

## Use case

The `addressInformation` endpoint is useful for applications that need complete contract details:

1. Block explorers displaying full contract information.
2. Smart contract analysis tools examining code and data.
3. Wallet applications verifying contract state.
4. Development tools debugging contract behavior.
5. Security audits examining deployed contracts.

Here's an example of getting address information:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  curl -X GET \
    'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v3/addressInformation?address=EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs' \
    -H 'accept: application/json'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  This endpoint returns the raw code and data cells. Use [runGetMethod](/reference/ton-rungetmethod-v3) to interact with the contract's get methods for parsed data.
