## Pre-built JavaScript-based tracers

<Info>
  ### Custom tracers are available on customized dedicated nodes only

  Custom JavaScript tracers outside of the ones listed below are available as customized solutions on the [Enterprise plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) on [dedicated nodes](/docs/dedicated-node).
</Info>

Developers can customize the type of tracing using various debug and trace methods, and there are numerous pre-built tracers available to choose from. Further is a list of the pre-built tracers that can be utilized.

### `4byteTracer`

This tracer looks for function signatures that are 4 bytes long during contract execution and gathers information about the method identifiers and the size of the provided data. This information can be helpful in matching a signature against the data size.

### `callTracer`

This tracer extracts information about all internal calls made by a transaction, providing visibility into how contracts interact with each other.

### `prestateTracer`

This tracer returns sufficient information about an account to create a local execution of the transaction. This procedure runs the given transaction again and monitors every aspect of the state that is modified or accessed during execution.

### `noopTracer`

This tracer does nothing but respond with a blank object. This a no operations tracer for testing setup.
