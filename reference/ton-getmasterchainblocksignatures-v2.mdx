**TON pricing is the same for full, archive, v2, v3**

There's no difference between a full node an archive node in data availability or pricing.  
All data is always available and all node requests are consumed as 1 request unit.

## Parameters

* `seqno` (integer, required) — The sequence number of the masterchain block for which to retrieve signatures. Example: `39064874`.

## JSON-RPC example

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v2/jsonRPC' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getMasterchainBlockSignatures",
    "params": {
      "seqno": 39064874
    }
  }'
```


## Response

* `signatures` (array of objects) — An array of signature objects, each containing:
  + `node_id` (string) — The ID of the validator node that provided the signature.
  + `r` (string) — The 'r' component of the signature.
  + `s` (string) — The 's' component of the signature.
* `validator_set_hash` (string) — The hash of the validator set that signed this block.
* `catchain_seqno` (integer) — The sequence number in the catchain (consensus protocol).

## Use case

A possible use case for the `getMasterchainBlockSignatures` method in TON is for applications or services that need to verify the authenticity and consensus of masterchain blocks. This method can be used to:

1. Implement custom block validation logic in light clients or explorers.
2. Verify the consensus reached for a specific block by checking the signatures.
3. Analyze validator participation and performance in block signing.
4. Provide transparency and auditability for critical blockchain operations.
