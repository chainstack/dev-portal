# Pending Transactions

The `pendingTransactions` endpoint retrieves transactions that are pending finalization in the TON blockchain. These are transactions that have been included in a block but may not yet be fully confirmed.

All data is always available and all node requests are consumed as 1 request unit.

## Parameters

* `account` (string, optional) — Filter by account address.
* `limit` (integer, optional) — Maximum number of transactions to return. Default: `10`.
* `offset` (integer, optional) — Number of transactions to skip for pagination. Default: `0`.

## Response

* `transactions` (array) — Array of pending transaction objects:
  * `account` (string) — Account address.
  * `hash` (string) — Transaction hash.
  * `lt` (integer) — Logical time.
  * `now` (integer) — Unix timestamp.
  * `mc_block_seqno` (integer) — Masterchain block sequence number.
  * `trace_id` (string) — Associated trace ID.

## Use case

The `pendingTransactions` endpoint is useful for monitoring real-time transaction status:

1. Wallet applications showing recently submitted transactions before full confirmation.
2. Trading bots tracking order execution in real-time.
3. Payment systems providing instant feedback on transaction status.
4. Block explorers showing live transaction feeds.
5. Monitoring systems tracking specific account activity.

Here's an example of getting pending transactions:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  curl -X GET \
    'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v3/pendingTransactions?limit=5' \
    -H 'accept: application/json'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Pending transactions will eventually move to the regular [transactions](/reference/ton-transactions-v3) endpoint once fully confirmed. Use this endpoint for real-time monitoring.
