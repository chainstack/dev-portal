## Parameters

* `address` — hexadecimal address of the account to query for reward information

## Response

* `reward` — total amount of TRX rewards available for withdrawal (in sun units, where 1 TRX = 1,000,000 sun)

## Use case

The `wallet/getreward` method is used for:

* Checking available voting rewards before claiming them.
* Monitoring reward accumulation from witness voting activities.
* Building reward tracking dashboards for voter accounts.
* Calculating potential returns from voting for specific witnesses.
* Automating reward claim notifications and processes.

<Note>
Rewards are accumulated automatically when you vote for witnesses who share their block production rewards. The reward amount is returned in sun units (1 TRX = 1,000,000 sun). Use the `withdrawbalance` method to claim accumulated rewards.
