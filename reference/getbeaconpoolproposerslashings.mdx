<Note>
**Empty data response**

Proposer slashings are infrequent events, so most of the time you will have the "data": [] response.
</Note>


The `/eth/v1/beacon/pool/proposer_slashings` method is a crucial API endpoint in the Ethereum Beacon Chain, offering data on proposer slashings. Proposer slashing is a serious penalty mechanism applied to validators who are found to have proposed conflicting blocks—a behavior considered harmful to the network's integrity and security. This endpoint allows developers and network participants to access information about such slashings, which is vital for maintaining network health and understanding validator behavior.

### Parameters

* `none`

### Response

* `array` — list of proposer slashing objects.
  + Each `object` in the array represents a proposer slashing event, containing:
    - `proposer_index` — the index of the validator who was slashed for proposing conflicting blocks.
    - `header_1` and `header_2` — the conflicting beacon block headers submitted by the slashed proposer. These headers are evidence of the malicious action that led to the slashing.
      * Each header includes:
        + `slot`: The slot number at which the block was proposed.
        + `proposer_index`: The index of the validator who proposed the block.
        + `parent_root`: The root of the parent block, linking the chain's continuity.
        + `state_root`: The root of the beacon chain state after the block's effect.
        + `body_root`: The root of the block's body, encapsulating the block's transactions and attestations.
    - `signature` — the signature of the slashed validator, associated with the malicious blocks they proposed.
    - `message_hash` — a hash of the slashing message, providing a cryptographic proof of the slashing event.

The `/eth/v1/beacon/pool/proposer_slashings` method serves as a critical tool for monitoring and understanding the security of the Ethereum network, offering transparent access to instances where validators have acted against the network's best interests.
