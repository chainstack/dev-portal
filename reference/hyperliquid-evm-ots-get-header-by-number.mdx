<Info>
This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available on Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support them yet — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `ots_getHeaderByNumber` JSON-RPC method retrieves block header information by block number on the Hyperliquid EVM blockchain. This Otterscan-specific method provides a lightweight way to fetch block headers without retrieving full block data, making it efficient for block explorer operations.

## Use cases

The `ots_getHeaderByNumber` method is essential for:

* **Block explorers**: Efficiently fetch block header information without full block data
* **Light clients**: Verify blockchain state with minimal data requirements
* **Node detection**: Identify if a node supports Otterscan APIs
* **Block monitoring**: Track new blocks with reduced bandwidth usage
* **Chain analysis**: Analyze block production patterns and timing
* **Header verification**: Validate block headers for security checks
* **Timestamp tracking**: Monitor block timestamps for time-based operations
* **Gas analysis**: Track gas usage and limits across blocks
* **Fork detection**: Monitor chain reorganizations via parent hash tracking
* **Performance optimization**: Reduce data transfer when only header data is needed

This method is part of the Otterscan API suite, providing optimized access patterns for blockchain exploration tools.
