TRON API method that calls a constant (read-only) smart contract method without consuming energy or bandwidth. This method allows you to query contract state and call view functions without broadcasting a transaction to the blockchain.

## Parameters

* `owner_address` — (optional) address calling the contract method in hexadecimal format
* `contract_address` — smart contract address to call in hexadecimal format
* `function_selector` — function signature or selector (e.g., "balanceOf(address)")
* `parameter` — (optional) encoded parameters for the function call in hexadecimal format

## Response

* `result` — execution result object containing:
  * `result` — boolean indicating if the call was successful
* `energy_used` — estimated energy consumption if this were a real transaction
* `constant_result` — array of return values from the contract method in hexadecimal format
* `transaction` — transaction object that would be created (for reference, not executed)

## Use case

The `wallet/triggerconstantcontract` method is used for:

* Calling read-only smart contract methods to query blockchain state.
* Reading token balances, contract variables, and other view data without costs.
* Testing contract method calls before executing actual transactions.
* Building user interfaces that need to display current contract state.
* Implementing contract interaction tools that require state queries.
* Estimating energy costs for contract method calls before execution.
