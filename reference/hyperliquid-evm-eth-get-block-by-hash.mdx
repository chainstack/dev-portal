<Info>
This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available on Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support them yet — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `eth_getBlockByHash` JSON-RPC method returns information about a block by its hash. This method is essential for retrieving detailed block information when you have the block hash, commonly used for block exploration, transaction verification, and blockchain analysis.

## Parameters

The method takes two parameters:

1. **Block hash** - The hash of the block to retrieve
2. **Full transaction objects** - Whether to return full transaction objects or just hashes

### Parameter details

* `blockHash` (string, required) — The 32-byte hash of the block to retrieve
* `fullTransactionObjects` (boolean, required) — If `true`, returns full transaction objects; if `false`, returns only transaction hashes

## Response

The method returns detailed information about the specified block, or `null` if the block is not found.

### Response structure

**Block object:**
- `number` — Block number as a hexadecimal string
- `hash` — The 32-byte hash of the block
- `parentHash` — Hash of the parent block
- `timestamp` — Block timestamp as a Unix timestamp in hexadecimal
- `gasLimit` — Maximum gas allowed in this block
- `gasUsed` — Total gas used by all transactions in the block
- `transactions` — Array of transaction hashes or full transaction objects
- `miner` — Address of the block miner/validator
- `difficulty` — Block difficulty (may be 0 for some consensus mechanisms)
- `totalDifficulty` — Total difficulty of the chain until this block
- `size` — Block size in bytes as a hexadecimal string
- `extraData` — Extra data field of the block
- `nonce` — Block nonce (if applicable)
- `receiptsRoot` — Root hash of the receipts trie
- `stateRoot` — Root hash of the state trie
- `transactionsRoot` — Root hash of the transactions trie

### Transaction data format

**With fullTransactionObjects = false:**
- Returns array of transaction hashes as strings
- Minimal data transfer for basic block information
- Suitable for block overview and transaction counting

**With fullTransactionObjects = true:**
- Returns array of complete transaction objects
- Includes all transaction details (from, to, value, gas, etc.)
- Larger response but comprehensive transaction data

## Hyperliquid-specific considerations

### System transactions

**HyperCore transactions:**
- Blocks may contain system transactions that originate from HyperCore
- Use `eth_getSystemTxsByBlockHash` to retrieve system transactions specifically
- System transactions are separate from regular user transactions
- Important for complete block analysis and understanding network activity

### Block data interpretation

**Transaction types:**
- Regular transactions: Standard user-initiated transactions
- System transactions: Transactions originating from HyperCore
- Both types contribute to block gas usage and transaction count

**Data analysis:**
- Consider both regular and system transactions for complete analysis
- System transactions may have different patterns and characteristics
- Use appropriate methods to retrieve the specific transaction type needed

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByHash","params":["0x53e84f299e6893680383c6a53329574122a7292e5bb9397bb6a0b51b4db5957a",false],"id":1}' \

```

## Use cases

The `eth_getBlockByHash` method is essential for applications that need to:

* **Block explorers**: Display detailed block information and navigation
* **Transaction verification**: Confirm transaction inclusion in specific blocks
* **Blockchain analytics**: Analyze block data for network insights
* **Audit systems**: Verify block integrity and transaction history
* **Development tools**: Debug and test blockchain applications
* **Monitoring systems**: Track block production and network health
* **DeFi protocols**: Verify block-based events and state changes
* **System transaction analysis**: Analyze both regular and HyperCore system transactions
* **Network diagnostics**: Troubleshoot blockchain synchronization issues
* **Integration services**: Provide block data to external systems

<Note>
Block hashes are unique identifiers. If a block hash doesn't exist or is invalid, the method returns `null`. On Hyperliquid, blocks may contain system transactions from HyperCore - use `eth_getSystemTxsByBlockHash` to retrieve these separately.
