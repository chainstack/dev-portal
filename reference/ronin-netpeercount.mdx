## Parameters

* `none`

## Response

* `result` â€” the number of connected peers, encoded as a hexadecimal value. This number reflects how well the node is connected to the rest of the network, which can impact its ability to receive and broadcast transactions and blocks.

## Use case

The `net_peerCount` method is crucial for network administrators and developers who need to monitor their node's health and connectivity. A higher number of peers indicates good network health and connectivity, while a low number of peers might suggest network issues or isolation from the network.
