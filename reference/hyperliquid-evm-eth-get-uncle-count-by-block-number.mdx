## Parameters

* `blockNumber` (string, required) — Block number in hex format, or one of the special tags: "earliest", "latest", "pending", or "finalized"

## Returns

Returns the number of uncle blocks as a hex-encoded integer, or `null` if the block is not found.

<Note>
On Hyperliquid, uncle blocks are not part of the consensus mechanism. This method is included for Ethereum compatibility but will typically return "0x0" as Hyperliquid doesn't produce uncle blocks.
</Note>

## Use cases

* **Ethereum compatibility** — Maintain compatibility with Ethereum RPC interfaces
* **Network monitoring** — Track uncle block production across different block heights
* **Performance analysis** — Analyze network efficiency and block production patterns
* **Compatibility testing** — Verify application behavior when migrating from Ethereum
* **Protocol comparison** — Compare consensus mechanisms between networks
* **API completeness** — Implement full Ethereum RPC compatibility
