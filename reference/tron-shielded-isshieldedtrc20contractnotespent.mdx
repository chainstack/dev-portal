<Warning>
All hex values (`ak`, `nk`, `rcm`) must be provided **without the 0x prefix** and must be exactly 64 hexadecimal characters (32 bytes). The `shielded_TRC20_contract_address` must be in **hex format** (starting with 41), not base58 format. The `value` represents the scaled value multiplied by the contract's scalingFactor.
</Warning>

## Parameters

* `note` — the note object to check for spending status
  * `value` — scaled value (multiplied by contract's scalingFactor)
  * `payment_address` — shielded payment address (ztron1 format)
  * `rcm` — random commitment trapdoor (64 hex characters, no `0x` prefix)
* `ak` — authorization key (64 hex characters, no `0x` prefix)
* `nk` — nullifier key (64 hex characters, no `0x` prefix)
* `position` — leaf position index in Merkle tree
* `shielded_TRC20_contract_address` — the shielded TRC20 contract address (hex format starting with 41, no `0x` prefix)

## Response

* `is_spent` — boolean indicating if the note has been spent (true = spent, false = unspent)

## Use case

The `wallet/isshieldedtrc20contractnotespent` method is used for:

* Preventing double-spending attacks in shielded transactions
* Validating that notes are available for spending before creating transactions
* Maintaining the security and integrity of the shielded transaction system
* Supporting wallet implementations that need to track note spending status

<Info>
The nullifier key (nk) and authorization key (ak) are used together with the note's position in the Merkle tree to generate a unique nullifier for each note. This nullifier is checked to determine if the note has been spent, preventing double-spending while maintaining privacy. The note's value is scaled by the contract's scalingFactor to maintain precision in token amounts.
