Base API method `eth_getFilterLogs` retrieves all logs matching a previously created filter. This method is essential for applications that need to fetch historical log data based on specific criteria.

<Warning>
**Disclaimer**

Note that the default interactive example in this page will not work as the filter will be expired.

To test `eth_getFilterLogs` in this page, first create a new filter using one of the following:

* [eth\_newFilter](/api-reference/base_node_api/eth_newFilter)
* [eth\_newBlockFilter](/api-reference/base_node_api/eth_newBlockFilter)

Then use the fresh filter ID as the parameter for `eth_getFilterChanges`.

## Parameters

* `filterId` — the ID of the filter for which logs are being fetched. This ID is returned by filter creation methods such as `eth_newBlockFilter`, or `eth_newFilter`. For this example, a random value `"0x5a6b7c"` is used.

## Response

* `result` — an array of log objects. Each log object contains details such as whether the log was removed (due to a chain reorganization), log index, transaction index, transaction hash, block hash, block number, address from which the log originated, data contained in the log, and topics associated with the log.

## Use case

The `eth_getFilterLogs` method is essential for:

* DApps that require access to historical log data for analysis or display purposes.
* Services that monitor smart contract interactions over time, needing to retrieve all past events that match certain criteria.
* Analytical tools that process and visualize blockchain data based on logs from specific contracts or transactions.
