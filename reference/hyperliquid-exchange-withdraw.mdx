```shell cURL
curl -X POST https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/exchange \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": {

  }'
```

```python Python
from hyperliquid.exchange import Exchange
from hyperliquid.utils import constants
import eth_account

# Initialize with your private key
account = eth_account.Account.from_key("0x...")
exchange = Exchange(account, constants.MAINNET_API_URL)

# Withdraw 100.5 USDC to Arbitrum
withdrawal_result = exchange.withdraw_usdc(
    destination="0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb0",
    amount=100.5
)

print(withdrawal_result)
```

## Response example

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "response": {
    "type": "default"
  }
}
```

## Withdrawal process

1. **Initiation** — Request sent to Hyperliquid
2. **Validation** — System validates balance and parameters
3. **Signing** — L1 validators sign the withdrawal
4. **Bridge interaction** — Withdrawal sent to Arbitrum bridge contract
5. **Completion** — USDC arrives in Arbitrum wallet (~5 minutes)

## Use cases

* **Profit taking** — Withdraw trading profits to Arbitrum
* **Bridge to other chains** — Move funds to Arbitrum for further bridging
* **Risk management** — Reduce exposure by moving funds off-platform
* **Treasury management** — Regular withdrawal schedules

<Note>
Ensure you have enough USDC to cover both the withdrawal amount and the $1 fee. The fee is deducted from your Hyperliquid balance, not from the withdrawal amount.
</Note>

<Warning>
Withdrawals are irreversible once initiated. Always verify the destination address on Arbitrum. The address must be a valid Arbitrum address that can receive USDC.
