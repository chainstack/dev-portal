TRON API method that creates parameters for a shielded TRC20 contract transaction without requiring the authentication secret key (ask). This simplified version is used when the ask is not available or needed for the specific transaction type.

<Warning>
This endpoint requires valid shielded addresses and cryptographic material. All parameters must be properly formatted: shielded addresses must be valid ztron1 addresses, the outgoing viewing key must be a valid 0x-prefixed hex string, and optional transparent addresses must be valid TRON addresses (starting with T). Invalid or placeholder values will result in parsing errors.
</Warning>

## Parameters

* `ovk` — the outgoing viewing key for transaction monitoring (0x-prefixed hex string)
* `from_address` — the sender's shielded address (ztron1 format)
* `to_address` — the recipient's shielded address (ztron1 format)
* `amount` — the amount to transfer (in sun, as string)
* `transparent_from_address` — optional transparent sender address (T-address format)
* `transparent_to_address` — optional transparent recipient address (T-address format)

## Response

* `receive_description` — the receive description for the shielded transaction
* `spend_description` — the spend description for the shielded transaction
* `binding_signature` — the binding signature that ties the transaction together

## Use case

The `wallet/createshieldedcontractparameterswithoutask` method is used for:

* Creating shielded transaction parameters without access to authentication secret keys
* Generating transaction data for view-only or monitoring applications
* Supporting simplified wallet implementations that don't store sensitive key material
* Enabling third-party services to prepare shielded transactions with limited key access
