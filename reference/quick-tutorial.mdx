## Overview

To get from zero to a running consortium network through the Chainstack API, do the following:

<Steps>
<Step>
Get your API key.
</Step>
<Step>
Export your API variables.
</Step>
<Step>
Create a project.
</Step>
<Step>
Create a network.
</Step>
<Step>
Add a node to the network.
</Step>
<Step>
Get the node access and credentials.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step-by-step

### Get your API key

See [Create an API key](/reference/platform-api-getting-started#create-api-key).

### Export your API variables

To save time when interacting with the API, export your API variables:

<CodeGroup>
  ```sh Shell
  export APIURL="https://api.chainstack.com/v1"
  export APIKEY="YOUR_CHAINSTACK_API_KEY"
  export HDR_AUTH="Authorization: Bearer $APIKEY"
  export HDR_CT="Content-Type: application/json"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Create a project

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl cURL
  curl -X POST "$APIURL/projects/" --header "$HDR_AUTH" --header "$HDR_CT" --data '{"name":"YOUR_PROJECT_NAME","description":"YOUR_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION"}'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

See also API reference: [Create Project](/reference/chainstack-platform-api-create-project).

### Create a network

You create a network with one peer node and service nodes.

The service nodes are created automatically with no input from you.

You must provide the node details for your peer node.

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl cURL
  curl -X POST "$APIURL/networks/" --header "$HDR_AUTH" --header "$HDR_CT" --data '{"name":"NETWORK_NAME","project":"PROJECT_ID","protocol":"PROTOCOL","configuration":{"consensus":"CONSENSUS"},"nodes":[{"name":"NODE_NAME","type":"NODE_TYPE","role":"NODE_ROLE","provider":"CLOUD_PROVIDER","region":"LOCATION","configuration":{}}]}'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where

* NETWORK\_NAME — any name you want to give to your network.

* PROJECT\_ID — the ID of the project where the network will be deployed. You can get project IDs by running `curl -X GET "$APIURL/projects/" --header "$HDR_AUTH"`.

* PROTOCOL — the protocol of the network you want to deploy:

  * `corda` — Corda
  * `fabric` — Hyperledger Fabric
  * `quorum` — Quorum
  * `multichain` — MultiChain

* CONSENSUS — the consensus of the protocol you want to deploy:

  * [Corda Single Notary](/docs/about-corda#consensus) — `single-notary`
  * [Hyperledger Fabric Raft](/docs/about-hyperledger-fabric#consensus) — `raft`
  * [Quorum Raft](/docs/about-quorum#raft) — `raft`
  * [Quorum IBFT](/docs/about-quorum#ibft) — `ibft`
  * [MultiChain round-robin](/docs/about-multichain#consensus) — `round-robin`.

* NODE\_NAME — any name you want to give to your first peer node deployed as part of the network.

* NODE\_TYPE — `dedicated` is the only available option for consortium networks.

* NODE\_ROLE — use the `peer` value for the role since you are providing node details for your peer node.

* CLOUD\_PROVIDER — choose the cloud provider for your node:

  * `aws` — Amazon Web Services
  * `azure` — Microsoft Azure
  * `gcloud` — Google Cloud Platform

* LOCATION — choose the location for your network:

  * `ap-southeast-1` — Singapore. Available only for Amazon Web Services (`aws`).
  * `us-east-1` — the United States, Northern Virginia. Available only for Amazon Web Services (`aws`).
  * `us-west-2` — the United States, Oregon. Available only for Amazon Web Services (`aws`).
  * `uksouth` — the United Kingdom, London. Available only for Microsoft Azure (`azure`).
  * `asia-southeast1` — Singapore. Available only for Google Cloud Platform (`gcloud`).

Example to create a Corda network on Google Cloud Platform in Singapore:

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl cURL
  curl -X POST "$APIURL/networks/" --header "$HDR_AUTH" --header "$HDR_CT" --data '{"name":"NETWORK_NAME","project":"PR-123-456","protocol":"corda","configuration":{"consensus":"single-notary"},"nodes":[{"name":"My node name","type":"dedicated","role":"peer","provider":"gcloud","region":"asia-southeast1","configuration":{}}]}'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

See also API reference: [Create Network](/reference/chainstack-platform-api-create-network).

### Add a peer node to the network

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl cURL
  curl -X POST "$APIURL/nodes/" --header "$HDR_AUTH" --header "$HDR_CT" --data '{"name":"NODE_NAME","network":"NETWORK_ID","type": "dedicated","role":"peer","provider":"CLOUD_PROVIDER","region":"LOCATION","configuration":{}}'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where

* NODE\_NAME — any name you want to give to your node.

* NETWORK\_ID — the ID of the network where the node will be deployed. You can get network IDs by running `curl -X GET "$APIURL/networks/" --header "$HDR_AUTH"`.

* CLOUD\_PROVIDER — choose the cloud provider for your node:

  * `aws` — Amazon Web Services
  * `azure` — Microsoft Azure
  * `gcloud` — Google Cloud Platform

* LOCATION — choose the location for your network:

  * `ap-southeast-1` — Singapore. Available only for Amazon Web Services (`aws`).
  * `us-east-1` — the United States, Northern Virginia. Available only for Amazon Web Services (`aws`).
  * `us-west-2` — the United States, Oregon. Available only for Amazon Web Services (`aws`).
  * `uksouth` — the United Kingdom, London. Available only for Microsoft Azure (`azure`).
  * `asia-southeast1` — Singapore. Available only for Google Cloud Platform (`gcloud`).

Example to add a node on Microsoft Azure in London:

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl cURL
  curl -X POST "$APIURL/nodes/" --header "$HDR_AUTH" --header "$HDR_CT" --data '{"name":"My node name","network":"NW-123-456-7","type": "dedicated","role":"peer","provider":"azure","region":"uksouth","configuration":{}}'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

See also API reference: [Create Node](/reference/chainstack-platform-api-create-node).

### Get the node access and credentials

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl cURL
  curl -X GET "$APIURL/nodes/NODE_ID/" --header "$HDR_AUTH"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where NODE\_ID — the ID of the node. You can get node IDs by running `curl -X GET "$APIURL/nodes/" --header "$HDR_AUTH"`.

See also API reference: [Retrieve Node](/reference/chainstack-platform-api-retrieve-node).

You have created a consortium project, deployed a consortium network, added a node to the network, and retrived the node's access and credentials.
