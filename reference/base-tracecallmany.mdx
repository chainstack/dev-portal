openapi: /openapi/base_node_api/debug_traceCallMany.json POST /2fc1de7f08c0465f6a28e3c355e0cb14

Executes a list of bundles (a bundle is a collection of transactions), without creating transactions on the blockchain. Returns their traces. This method is akin to `eth_callMany` but provides detailed execution traces for each call, making it invaluable for debugging complex interactions involving multiple transactions.

## Request

To use `debug_traceCallMany`, send a POST request with a JSON RPC call in the body.

## Parameters

* **transactions** (`array`): An array of transaction objects to be executed. Each transaction object includes:
  + **from** (`string`): The address the transaction is sent from (optional).
  + **to** (`string`): The address the transaction is directed to.
  + **gas** (`string`): The gas limit for the transaction.
  + **gasPrice** (`string`): The gas price for the transaction.
  + **data** (`string`): The data sent along with the transaction.
* **blockOverride** (`object`): Optional overrides for the execution context block header, including:
  + **blockNumber** (`string`): Block number for the execution context.
* **Simulation Context** (`object`): The context for the simulation, including block number and transaction index.
* **State Overrides** (`object`): Optional state overrides for the execution context.

## Response

The response includes detailed execution traces for each call in the bundles, providing insights into each step of the transactions' execution.

* **result** (`array`): An array of execution traces for each call, including:
  + **structLogs** (`array`): An array of execution steps (opcodes) taken by the call.
  + **gas** (`integer`): The gas provided by the call.
  + **returnValue** (`string`): The return value of the call, if any.
  + **gasUsed** (`integer`): The total gas used by the call.
  + **failed** (`boolean`): Indicates whether the call failed.

## Use case

The `debug_traceCallMany` method is essential for:

* Developers debugging complex interactions involving multiple transactions.
* Analysts conducting forensic analysis of transaction sequences.
* Tools and services that provide insights into Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution across multiple calls.
