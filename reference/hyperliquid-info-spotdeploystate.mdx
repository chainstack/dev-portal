## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"spotDeployState"` to retrieve spot deployment state information.
* `user` (string, required) — Address in 42-character hexadecimal format. Can be zero address (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`) for global state information.

## Response

The response is an object with two primary sections:

### States

Array of token genesis entries. Each entry includes:

- `token` (integer) — Token ID.
- `spec` (object) — Token spec with:
  - `name` (string)
  - `szDecimals` (number)
  - `weiDecimals` (number)
- `fullName` (string, optional)
- `spots` (array of integers) — Spot pair indices associated with the token.
- `maxSupply` (integer)
- `hyperliquidityGenesisBalance` (string)
- `totalGenesisBalanceWei` (string)
- `userGenesisBalances` (array) — Tuples of `[address, balance]` in string form.
- `existingTokenGenesisBalances` (array) — Tuples of `[tokenIndex, balance]` in string form.

### Gas auction

Current auction parameters:

- `startTimeSeconds` (integer) — Auction start time (seconds since epoch).
- `durationSeconds` (integer) — Auction duration in seconds.
- `startGas` (string) — Starting gas amount.
- `currentGas` (string or null) — Current gas amount.
- `endGas` (string, optional) — Ending gas amount when completed.

### Understanding spot token deployment

**Deployment process:**
- Users submit token deployment requests with specified parameters
- Requests are queued and processed based on system capacity
- Successful deployments create new tradeable spot tokens
- Deployed tokens become available for spot trading

**System parameters:**
- **Deployment cost**: Fee required to deploy new tokens
- **Supply limits**: Minimum and maximum token supply constraints
- **Queue management**: Fair processing of deployment requests

**Token lifecycle:**
- **Request submission**: Users submit deployment parameters
- **Queue processing**: Requests are processed in order
- **Token creation**: Successful deployments create new tokens
- **Trading availability**: Deployed tokens become tradeable

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "spotDeployState", "user": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"}' \

```

## Use case

The `info` endpoint with `type: "spotDeployState"` is useful for:

- **Auction monitoring**: Read current `gasAuction` timing and gas parameters.
- **Genesis state inspection**: Review token `states` and genesis balances.
- **Discovery**: Identify tokens and spot indices associated with upcoming or configured deployments.

This endpoint is particularly valuable for token creators, market participants interested in new token launches, and platforms that need to monitor or facilitate spot token deployments on the Hyperliquid exchange. It provides essential visibility into the token deployment ecosystem and system operational status.
