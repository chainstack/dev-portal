## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"spotDeployState"` to retrieve spot deployment state information.
* `user` (string, required) — Address in 42-character hexadecimal format. Can be zero address (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`) for global state information.

## Response

The response is an object containing comprehensive spot token deployment system information:

### System configuration

* `deploymentEnabled` (boolean, optional) — Whether new spot token deployments are currently enabled
* `totalDeployments` (integer, optional) — Total number of tokens deployed on the spot system
* `systemStatus` (string, optional) — Current status of the deployment system:
  * `"active"` — System is operational and accepting deployments
  * `"maintenance"` — System is under maintenance
  * `"paused"` — Deployments are temporarily paused

### Deployment parameters

* `deploymentCost` (string, optional) — Cost to deploy a new spot token expressed in USD
* `maxSupply` (string, optional) — Maximum token supply allowed for new deployments
* `minSupply` (string, optional) — Minimum token supply required for new deployments

### Deployment queue

* `deploymentQueue` (array, optional) — Queue of pending token deployments:
  * `deployer` (string) — Address of the token deployer
  * `tokenName` (string) — Name of the token to be deployed
  * `tokenSymbol` (string) — Symbol of the token to be deployed
  * `supply` (string) — Initial supply of the token
  * `queuePosition` (integer) — Position in the deployment queue
  * `estimatedDeployTime` (integer) — Estimated deployment timestamp in milliseconds

### Recent deployments

* `recentDeployments` (array, optional) — Recently deployed tokens:
  * `tokenAddress` (string) — Contract address of the deployed token
  * `tokenName` (string) — Name of the deployed token
  * `tokenSymbol` (string) — Symbol of the deployed token
  * `deployer` (string) — Address of the token deployer
  * `deployTime` (integer) — Deployment timestamp in milliseconds
  * `initialSupply` (string) — Initial supply of the deployed token

### Understanding spot token deployment

**Deployment process:**
- Users submit token deployment requests with specified parameters
- Requests are queued and processed based on system capacity
- Successful deployments create new tradeable spot tokens
- Deployed tokens become available for spot trading

**System parameters:**
- **Deployment cost**: Fee required to deploy new tokens
- **Supply limits**: Minimum and maximum token supply constraints
- **Queue management**: Fair processing of deployment requests

**Token lifecycle:**
- **Request submission**: Users submit deployment parameters
- **Queue processing**: Requests are processed in order
- **Token creation**: Successful deployments create new tokens
- **Trading availability**: Deployed tokens become tradeable

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "spotDeployState", "user": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"}' \
  https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/4f8d8f4040bdacd1577bff8058438274/info
```

## Use case

The `info` endpoint with `type: "spotDeployState"` is essential for applications that need to:

* **Token deployment planning**: Understand current deployment costs and requirements
* **Queue monitoring**: Track pending deployments and estimated processing times
* **System status checking**: Verify if deployments are currently available
* **Market analysis**: Monitor new token launches and deployment trends
* **Deployment interfaces**: Build tools for token deployment management
* **Investment research**: Track newly deployed tokens for investment opportunities
* **Compliance monitoring**: Monitor token deployment activity for regulatory purposes
* **Developer tools**: Create deployment management interfaces and dashboards
* **Market making**: Identify new tokens for market making opportunities
* **Analytics platforms**: Track deployment metrics and ecosystem growth
* **Token discovery**: Find recently deployed tokens for trading or analysis
* **System monitoring**: Track deployment system health and capacity
* **Cost planning**: Calculate deployment costs for token launch projects
* **Queue optimization**: Plan deployment timing based on current queue status

This endpoint is particularly valuable for token creators, market participants interested in new token launches, and platforms that need to monitor or facilitate spot token deployments on the Hyperliquid exchange. It provides essential visibility into the token deployment ecosystem and system operational status.
