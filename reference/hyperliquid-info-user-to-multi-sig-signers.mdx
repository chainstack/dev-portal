## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"userToMultiSigSigners"` to retrieve multi-signature signers.
* `user` (string, required) — User address in 42-character hexadecimal format (e.g., `0x3710f20c8a8b2781D878105Fbd61CC0c20fE0411`).

## Response

The response is an array of signer addresses associated with the user's multi-signature setup:

* **Signers array** (array of strings) — List of authorized signer addresses
  * Each element is a hexadecimal address string
  * Represents accounts that can participate in multi-signature operations
  * Empty array indicates no multi-signature setup or no authorized signers

### Understanding multi-signature signers

**Multi-signature functionality:**
- Allows multiple parties to control a single account or execute transactions
- Enhances security by requiring multiple approvals for sensitive operations
- Commonly used for institutional accounts, DAOs, and shared custody arrangements
- Signers are pre-authorized addresses that can participate in multi-sig operations

**Signer management:**
- Users can add or remove signers through governance or administrative functions
- Each signer has equal authority unless specified otherwise in the multi-sig contract
- Threshold requirements may apply (e.g., 2-of-3, 3-of-5 signatures required)
- Signer changes typically require existing signer approval

**Security considerations:**
- Multi-signature setups reduce single points of failure
- Distributed control among trusted parties or devices
- Protection against key compromise or loss
- Enhanced compliance for institutional requirements
