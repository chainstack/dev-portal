## Parameters

### Required parameters

* `action` (object, required) — The order action object containing:
  * `type` (string) — Must be `"order"`
  * `orders` (array) — Array of order objects with:
    * `a` (number) — Asset index (see asset notation below)
    * `b` (boolean) — Is buy order (true for buy/long, false for sell/short)
    * `p` (string) — Limit price (use "0" for market orders)
    * `s` (string) — Size in units of the base asset
    * `r` (boolean) — Reduce only order
    * `t` (object) — Order type specification:
      * For limit orders: `{"limit": {"tif": "Alo" | "Ioc" | "Gtc"}}`
      * For trigger orders: `{"trigger": {"isMarket": boolean, "triggerPx": string, "tpsl": "tp" | "sl"}}`
    * `c` (string, optional) — Client order ID (128-bit hex string)
  * `grouping` (string) — Order grouping: `"na"` | `"normalTpsl"` | `"positionTpsl"`
  * `builder` (object, optional) — Builder fee configuration:
    * `b` (string) — Builder address to receive fees
    * `f` (number) — Fee in tenths of a basis point

* `nonce` (number, required) — Current timestamp in milliseconds (must be recent)
* `signature` (object, required) — EIP-712 signature of the action

### Optional parameters

* `vaultAddress` (string, optional) — Address when trading on behalf of a vault or subaccount
* `expiresAfter` (number, optional) — Timestamp in milliseconds after which the order is rejected

## Asset notation

For perpetuals, use the index from the `universe` field in the meta response. For spot assets, use `10000 + index` where index is from `spotMeta.universe`.

Example: `PURR/USDC` spot has index 0 in spot metadata, so use asset `10000`.

## Order types

### Time in Force (TIF) for limit orders

* `Alo` — Add liquidity only (post-only), canceled if would immediately match
* `Ioc` — Immediate or cancel, unfilled portion canceled
* `Gtc` — Good til canceled, rests on book until filled or canceled

### Trigger orders

* `tp` — Take profit order
* `sl` — Stop loss order
* `isMarket` — Whether to place market order when triggered
* `triggerPx` — Price at which to trigger the order

## Returns

Returns an object with order placement status:

* `status` — `"ok"` if successful
* `response` — Contains order details:
  * `type` — `"order"`
  * `data.statuses` — Array of status objects for each order:
    * `resting` — Order placed on book with `oid` (order ID)
    * `filled` — Order immediately filled with `totalSz`, `avgPx`, and `oid`
    * `error` — Error message if order failed

## Use cases

* **Spot and perpetual trading** — Execute trades on Hyperliquid's order books

<Note>
Orders consume address-based rate limits. The `expiresAfter` field consumes 5x rate limit when orders expire due to staleness.
