title: jetton/burns | TON v3
openapi: "/openapi/ton_node_api/v3/getJettonBurns.json GET /jetton/burns"
---

The `jetton/burns` endpoint retrieves a list of Jetton burn events from the TON blockchain. This endpoint allows you to fetch information about Jettons that have been permanently removed from circulation and provides options for pagination and sorting.

Running the interactive example will return the amount of [DOGS burned](https://tonviewer.com/EQCvxJy4eG8hyHBFsZ7eePxrRsUQSFE_jpptRAYBmcG_DOGS).

## Use case

The `jetton/burns` endpoint is useful for various applications that need to track or analyze Jetton burn activities on the TON blockchain:

1. Analytics platforms can use this to monitor the reduction in circulating supply of various Jettons.
2. Wallet applications can show users their history of Jetton burn transactions.
3. Developers can use this endpoint to build notification systems for significant burn events.
4. Token issuers can track burn events to manage their token's supply and verify proper functioning of burn mechanisms.
5. Researchers can analyze burn patterns to study token economics and user behavior.
6. Compliance tools can use this data to monitor large burns or burns from specific addresses.
