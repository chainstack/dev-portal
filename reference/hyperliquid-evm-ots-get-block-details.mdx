<Info>
This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available on Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support them yet — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `ots_getBlockDetails` JSON-RPC method retrieves expanded block details by block number on the Hyperliquid EVM blockchain. This Otterscan-specific method provides a tailored response for block detail pages in block explorers, including calculated total fees and other aggregated information.

## Parameters

1. **block number** (integer, required): The block number to retrieve details for

## Response

The method returns an enhanced block object with additional calculated fields.

### Response structure

- `block` — standard block object with all transactions
  - `number` — the block number
  - `hash` — the block hash
  - `parentHash` — the parent block hash
  - `timestamp` — Unix timestamp of the block
  - `gasLimit` — maximum gas allowed in the block
  - `gasUsed` — total gas used by all transactions
  - `miner` — address that mined/validated the block
  - `baseFeePerGas` — base fee per gas (post-EIP-1559)
  - `transactions` — array of transaction objects
  - `transactionCount` — number of transactions in the block
- `issuance` — block reward issuance information
  - `blockReward` — reward for mining the block
  - `uncleReward` — rewards for uncle blocks
  - `issuance` — total new ETH issued
- `totalFees` — total transaction fees collected in the block (in wei)

## Usage example

## Use cases

The `ots_getBlockDetails` method is essential for:

* **Block explorers**: Display comprehensive block information pages
* **Fee analysis**: Calculate and display total fees collected in blocks
* **Mining analytics**: Track block rewards and issuance
* **Network monitoring**: Monitor block production and transaction throughput
* **Historical analysis**: Study block characteristics over time
* **Gas price tracking**: Analyze gas usage and pricing trends
* **MEV analysis**: Calculate MEV extraction by comparing fees
* **Validator performance**: Track validator rewards and efficiency
* **Chain analytics**: Generate statistics about block utilization
* **Research tools**: Analyze blockchain economics and fee markets

This method provides all the information needed to create detailed block explorer pages, eliminating the need for multiple API calls to gather block data.
