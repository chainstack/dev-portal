<Info>
This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available on Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support them yet — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `info` endpoint with `type: "perpAnnotation"` retrieves the annotation metadata for a specific HIP-3 deployed perpetual asset. Returns the deployer-set category and description for the given coin, or `null` if no annotation has been set.

Annotations are set by HIP-3 deployers using the `setPerpAnnotation` deployer action. Native Hyperliquid perps (BTC, ETH, etc.) are not HIP-3 deployed and will always return `null`.

## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"perpAnnotation"`.
* `coin` (string, required) — HIP-3 asset symbol in `deployer:TICKER` format (e.g., `"xyz:GOLD"`, `"birb:PENGU"`). Native perps like `"BTC"` always return `null`.

## Response

Returns an annotation object when the deployer has set metadata, or `null` if no annotation exists:

* `category` (string) — Category label, at most 15 characters. The official Hyperliquid UI only displays categories from a predefined set (e.g., `"indices"`, `"commodities"`, `"ai"`, `"meme"`, `"defi"`).
* `description` (string) — Description text, at most 400 characters. Deployers can use this as an onchain spec or link to external documentation.

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "perpAnnotation", "coin": "xyz:GOLD"}' \
  https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/4f8d8f4040bdacd1577bff8058438274/info
```

## Example response

When an annotation exists:

```json
{
  "category": "commodities",
  "description": "Gold spot price tracking contract"
}
```

When no annotation has been set (or for native perps like BTC):

```json
null
```

## Use case

The `info` endpoint with `type: "perpAnnotation"` is useful for:

* Displaying deployer-provided metadata about HIP-3 perpetual assets
* Building informational pages for deployed perpetual contracts
* Checking whether a perpetual has custom annotations before rendering UI
* Filtering HIP-3 assets by their deployer-assigned categories
