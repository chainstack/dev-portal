## What is the Aurora protocol?

Aurora, launched in 2021, is an Ethereum-compatible blockchain built on the NEAR Protocol. It offers a scalable and decentralized platform for developing DApps with the benefits of low transaction costs and high throughput. Aurora uses the Rainbow Bridge for asset transfers between Ethereum and NEAR and leverages the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to ensure compatibility with existing Ethereum DApps and tools.

Find useful Aurora tools in the [Aurora tooling](/docs/aurora-tooling) section.

## What is the Aurora API?

The Aurora API allows developers to interact with the Aurora blockchain, maintaining Ethereum compatibility while leveraging the NEAR Protocol's scalability advantages.

Aurora nodes provide access to a fully Ethereum-compatible RPC layer.

An application must connect to an Aurora RPC node to read data from and send transactions to the Aurora blockchain.

When communicating with an Aurora RPC node, the Aurora client supports the JSON-RPC specification, facilitating remote procedure calls as if they were local.

## How to start using the Aurora API

You need access to an Aurora RPC node to use the Aurora API.

Follow these steps to sign up on the Aurora platform, deploy an Aurora RPC node, and find your endpoint credentials:

<Steps>
<Step>
[Sign up with Chainstack](https://console.chainstack.com/user/account/create).
</Step>
<Step>
[Deploy a node](/docs/manage-your-networks#join-a-public-network).
</Step>
<Step>
[View node access and credentials](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).
</Step>
</Steps>
Now, you can connect to the Aurora blockchain and use the Aurora API to develop your applications.
