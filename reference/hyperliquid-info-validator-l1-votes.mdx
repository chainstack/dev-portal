## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"validatorL1Votes"` to retrieve validator L1 voting information.

## Response

The response is an array of validator voting information, including their L1 governance participation:

### Validator voting data

* `validator` (string) — Validator address in hexadecimal format
* `votingPower` (string) — Validator's voting power in the consensus mechanism
* `l1Votes` (array) — List of L1 votes cast by the validator:
  * `proposalId` (string) — Unique identifier for the governance proposal
  * `vote` (string) — Vote cast by the validator ("yes", "no", or "abstain")
  * `timestamp` (integer) — Timestamp when the vote was cast
  * `blockHeight` (integer) — Block height at which the vote was recorded
* `participationRate` (string) — Validator's participation rate in L1 governance

### Understanding L1 governance voting

**L1 governance structure:**
- Validators participate in network governance through on-chain voting
- Proposals affect protocol parameters, upgrades, and network policies
- Voting power typically correlates with validator stake and delegation
- Consensus mechanisms ensure democratic decision-making

**Voting mechanics:**
- Validators can vote "yes", "no", or "abstain" on proposals
- Voting periods have specific timeframes for participation
- Votes are recorded on-chain for transparency and immutability
- Participation rates indicate validator engagement in governance

**Governance importance:**
- Ensures decentralized decision-making for protocol evolution
- Validators represent delegator interests in governance decisions
- High participation rates indicate healthy network governance
- Voting history provides transparency for delegator selection

**Consensus participation:**
- Validators with higher voting power have greater influence
- Participation rates affect proposal outcomes and legitimacy
- Regular voting demonstrates validator commitment to network health
- Abstentions may indicate neutral positions or technical issues

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "validatorL1Votes"}' \

```

## Use case

The `info` endpoint with `type: "validatorL1Votes"` is essential for applications that need to:

* **Governance dashboards**: Display validator voting history and participation rates
* **Delegator tools**: Help users choose validators based on governance engagement
* **Compliance monitoring**: Track validator participation for regulatory requirements
* **Network analysis**: Analyze governance participation patterns and trends
* **Validator research**: Evaluate validator commitment to network governance
* **Proposal tracking**: Monitor voting progress and validator positions
* **Transparency tools**: Provide public access to governance voting records
* **Risk assessment**: Evaluate network governance health and participation
* **Automated alerts**: Notify stakeholders about important governance votes
