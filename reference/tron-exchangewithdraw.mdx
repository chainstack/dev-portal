- `owner_address` — the address withdrawing liquidity (base58 with `visible: true`, or hex with `visible: false`).
- `exchange_id` — unique identifier of the exchange pair to remove liquidity from.
- `token_id` — TRC10 token ID being withdrawn; use `_` to denote TRX.
- `quant` — integer amount to withdraw (token base units; if TRX, specify in sun).

## Response

Returns a transaction object containing:

- `txID` — unique transaction identifier
- `raw_data` — raw transaction data including contract details
- `raw_data_hex` — hexadecimal representation of raw transaction data

## Use case

The `wallet/exchangewithdraw` method is used for:

- Removing liquidity from trading pairs to claim earned fees
- Withdrawing capital from underperforming or deprecated markets
- Rebalancing liquidity provider positions across different pairs
- Exiting liquidity positions before market volatility or impermanent loss

## curl example

```shell Shell
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://tron-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/95e61622bf6a8af293978377718e3b77/wallet/exchangewithdraw' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "owner_address": "TLyqzVGLV1srkB7dToTAEqgDSfPtXRJZYH",
  "exchange_id": 1,
  "token_id": "1000001",
  "quant": 250000000000,
  "visible": true
}'
```

<Info>
- balances must be integers (do not quote numbers). When withdrawing TRX (using `token_id: "_"`), provide `quant` in sun (1 TRX = 1,000,000 sun).
- the call returns an unsigned transaction; sign and broadcast it. On mainnet, the exchange must exist, token must match the pair, and you must have sufficient LP position to withdraw.
