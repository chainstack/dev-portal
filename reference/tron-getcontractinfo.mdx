## Parameters

* `value` — contract address to retrieve information for
* `visible` — boolean indicating whether to use visible (Base58) address format instead of hex

## Response

* `contract_address` — the contract address
* `bytecode` — contract bytecode in hex format
* `name` — contract name if available
* `abi` — Application Binary Interface defining contract functions and events
* `source_map` — source code mapping for debugging purposes
* `source_code` — original contract source code if available
* `compiler_version` — Solidity compiler version used
* `consume_user_resource_percent` — percentage of user resources consumed
* `origin_address` — address that deployed the contract
* `origin_energy_limit` — energy limit set by contract creator
* `contract_state` — current state of the contract
* `code_hash` — hash of the contract code

## Use case

The `wallet/getcontractinfo` method is used for:

* Retrieving contract ABI for building function calls and parsing events.
* Verifying contract source code and understanding contract functionality.
* Building contract explorers and analysis tools for developers.
* Debugging contract deployments and understanding energy consumption settings.
* Implementing contract interaction interfaces in wallets and dApps.
* Auditing smart contracts and understanding their implementation details.
