The `eth_getCode` JSON-RPC method returns the bytecode of a smart contract at a given address and block. This method is essential for contract verification, analysis, and determining whether an address contains a smart contract or is an externally owned account (EOA).

## Parameters

The method takes two parameters:

1. **Address** - The contract address to retrieve bytecode from
2. **Block parameter** - The block at which to retrieve the code

### Parameter details

* `address` (string, required) — The 20-byte address to retrieve code from
* `block` (string, required) — Block identifier: `"latest"` (only the latest block is supported on Hyperliquid)

## Response

The method returns the contract bytecode as a hexadecimal string, or `"0x"` if no code exists at the address.


## Hyperliquid-specific considerations

### Block limitations

**Latest block only:**
- Only the `"latest"` block parameter is supported
- Historical contract code queries are not available in the default implementation
- All code retrieval is performed against the current state
- For historical analysis, consider using archive node implementations

### Contract analysis

**Address classification:**
- Distinguish between contracts and EOAs efficiently
- `"0x"` indicates an externally owned account (EOA)
- Non-empty bytecode indicates a smart contract
- Use for implementing different handling logic for different address types

## Example request

This an example call with wrapped HYPE (wHYPE) on the Hyperliquid mainnet deployed at [0x5555555555555555555555555555555555555555](https://hyperevmscan.io/token/0x5555555555555555555555555555555555555555).

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getCode","params":["0x5555555555555555555555555555555555555555","latest"],"id":1}' \

## Use cases

The `eth_getCode` method is essential for applications that need to:

* **Address classification**: Distinguish between smart contracts and EOAs
* **Contract verification**: Verify deployed contracts against expected bytecode
* **Security analysis**: Analyze contract bytecode for security patterns
* **Block explorers**: Display contract information and verification status
* **Development tools**: Build contract analysis and debugging tools
* **Wallet applications**: Verify contract authenticity before interactions
* **DeFi protocols**: Analyze and verify protocol contract implementations
* **Integration services**: Provide contract information to external systems

<Note>
On Hyperliquid, `eth_getCode` only supports the latest block. The returned bytecode is the runtime code deployed on the blockchain, not the constructor code. For EOAs (externally owned accounts), this method returns `"0x"`.
