# Events

The `events` endpoint queries blockchain events, which combine traces with their decoded actions. Events provide a complete view of what happened in a transaction flow, including all resulting actions.

<Note>
**TON pricing is the same for full, archive, v2, v3**

There's no difference between a full node an archive node in data availability or pricing.
All data is always available and all node requests are consumed as 1 request unit.

## Parameters

* `account` (string, optional) — Filter by account address.
* `start_utime` (integer, optional) — Start of time range (unix timestamp).
* `end_utime` (integer, optional) — End of time range (unix timestamp).
* `limit` (integer, optional) — Maximum number of events to return. Default: `10`.
* `offset` (integer, optional) — Number of events to skip for pagination. Default: `0`.
* `sort` (string, optional) — Sort order: `asc` or `desc`. Default: `desc`.

## Response

* `events` (array) — Array of event objects:
  * `trace_id` (string) — Trace ID.
  * `external_hash` (string) — Hash of the external message.
  * `mc_seqno_start` (string) — Start masterchain sequence number.
  * `mc_seqno_end` (string) — End masterchain sequence number.
  * `start_lt` (string) — Start logical time.
  * `start_utime` (integer) — Start unix timestamp.
  * `end_lt` (string) — End logical time.
  * `end_utime` (integer) — End unix timestamp.
  * `trace_info` (object) — Trace state and statistics.
  * `actions` (array) — Decoded actions from the event.
  * `is_incomplete` (boolean) — Whether the event is still processing.

* `address_book` (object) — Address book mapping.

## Use case

The `events` endpoint is useful for applications that need combined trace and action data:

1. Building activity feeds showing user transaction history.
2. Notification systems alerting on specific events.
3. Analytics dashboards tracking blockchain activity.
4. Block explorers showing transaction details with decoded actions.
5. Debugging complex multi-contract interactions.

Here's an example of getting recent events:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  curl -X GET \
    'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v3/events?limit=5' \
    -H 'accept: application/json'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Events combine the structure of [traces](/reference/ton-traces-v3) with the decoded information from [actions](/reference/ton-actions-v3), making them ideal for building user-facing transaction histories.
