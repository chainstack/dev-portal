---

The `eth_estimateGas` JSON-RPC method estimates the amount of gas required to execute a transaction without actually executing it on the blockchain. This method is essential for determining gas costs before sending transactions, helping users avoid failed transactions due to insufficient gas.

On Hyperliquid, gas estimation is performed against the latest block state only.

## Parameters

The method takes one parameter: a transaction object containing the transaction details.

### Transaction object

* `from` (string, optional) — The address the transaction is sent from
* `to` (string, optional) — The address the transaction is directed to
* `gas` (string, optional) — Integer of the gas provided for the transaction execution
* `gasPrice` (string, optional) — Integer of the gasPrice used for each paid gas
* `value` (string, optional) — Integer of the value sent with this transaction
* `data` (string, optional) — The compiled code of a contract OR the hash of the invoked method signature and encoded parameters

## Response

The method returns the estimated gas amount as a hexadecimal string.

### Response structure

**Gas estimate:**
- `result` — The estimated gas amount as a hexadecimal string

### Gas estimation accuracy

**Estimation considerations:**
- Estimates are based on the latest block state only (Hyperliquid limitation)
- Actual gas usage may vary if state changes before execution
- Complex transactions may have less accurate estimates
- Include a buffer (10-20%) when using estimates for actual transactions

**Factors affecting accuracy:**
- Contract complexity and execution paths
- State changes between estimation and execution
- Gas price fluctuations and network congestion
- Dynamic contract behavior based on inputs

**Hyperliquid considerations:**
- Estimates are based on latest block state only
- Monitor actual vs estimated gas usage for optimization
- Implement fallback gas limits for critical transactions

<Note>
On Hyperliquid, `eth_estimateGas` only supports the latest block state. Gas estimates may not be accurate for complex transactions or when the blockchain state changes between the estimate and actual execution. Always include a reasonable buffer when using estimates for actual transactions.
