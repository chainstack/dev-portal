The `trace_replayBlockTransactions` JSON-RPC method replays all transactions in a block and returns trace information for each transaction. This method provides detailed execution traces for all transactions in a specific block by replaying their execution, making it essential for comprehensive block analysis.

## Parameters

1. **Block identifier** (string, required): Block number, hash, or "latest"/"earliest"/"pending"
2. **Trace types** (array, required): Array of trace types to include in response

### Trace types

- `"trace"`: Basic execution trace information
- `"vmTrace"`: Virtual machine execution trace  
- `"stateDiff"`: State differences caused by transactions

## Response

The method returns an array of trace results for each transaction in the block.

### Response structure

**Block trace results:**
- Array of trace results, one per transaction in the block
- Each result contains detailed execution traces for the transaction

## Usage example

### Basic implementation

```javascript
// Replay all transactions in a block with tracing
const replayBlockTransactions = async (blockIdentifier, traceTypes = ['trace']) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/YOUR_ENDPOINT/evm', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      method: 'trace_replayBlockTransactions',
      params: [blockIdentifier, traceTypes],
      id: 1
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.result;
};

// Example usage
replayBlockTransactions('latest').then(results => {
  console.log(`Replayed ${results.length} transactions`);
  results.forEach((result, index) => {
    console.log(`Transaction ${index + 1}:`);
    if (result.trace) {
      result.trace.forEach(trace => {
        console.log(`  Gas used: ${parseInt(trace.result.gasUsed, 16)}`);
      });
    }
  });
});
```

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "trace_replayBlockTransactions",
    "params": [
      "latest",
      ["trace"]
    ],
    "id": 1
  }' \
