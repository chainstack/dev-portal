## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"metaAndAssetCtxs"` to retrieve asset contexts.

## Response

The response is an array containing two elements: universe metadata and asset contexts. This structure provides both static asset definitions and dynamic market data for all perpetual contracts.

### Response structure

The response contains exactly two elements:

1. **Universe metadata** — Static asset definitions and trading parameters
2. **Asset contexts** — Real-time market data for each asset

### Universe metadata structure

The first element contains the `universe` array with asset definitions:

**Asset identification:**
- `name` — Asset symbol (e.g., "BTC", "ETH", "AVAX")
- Corresponds to the perpetual contract identifier

**Trading parameters:**
- `szDecimals` — Number of decimal places for size precision
- `maxLeverage` — Maximum leverage allowed for this asset
- `onlyIsolated` — Boolean indicating if asset requires isolated margin mode

**Precision and constraints:**
- Size decimals determine minimum order size increments
- Max leverage sets risk management limits
- Isolated margin requirement affects trading strategies

### Asset contexts structure

The second element is an array of market data objects, one for each asset in the universe:

**Price information:**
- `markPx` — Current mark price used for margin calculations
- `midPx` — Mid price between best bid and ask
- `oraclePx` — Oracle price from external price feeds
- `prevDayPx` — Price from 24 hours ago for daily change calculation

**Market depth and impact:**
- `impactPxs` — Array of two impact prices [buy impact, sell impact]
- Shows expected price impact for market orders
- Useful for assessing market liquidity and slippage

**Funding and premium:**
- `funding` — Current funding rate for the perpetual contract
- `premium` — Premium of mark price over oracle price
- Indicates market sentiment and arbitrage opportunities

**Volume and interest:**
- `dayNtlVlm` — Daily notional volume traded
- `openInterest` — Total open interest across all positions
- Measures market activity and participation

### Data interpretation

**Price relationships:**
- Mark price vs oracle price indicates market premium/discount
- Mid price vs mark price shows funding impact
- Impact prices indicate market depth and liquidity

**Market health indicators:**
- High volume with stable prices indicates healthy liquidity
- Large premium suggests strong directional bias
- High open interest indicates active participation

**Trading insights:**
- Funding rates affect carry costs for positions
- Impact prices help estimate execution costs
- Volume patterns indicate market activity cycles

## Market analysis insights

### Liquidity assessment

**Market depth analysis:**
- Impact prices reveal available liquidity at different levels
- Tight spreads between impact prices indicate deep markets
- Wide spreads suggest lower liquidity or higher volatility

**Volume analysis:**
- Daily notional volume shows market activity levels
- Compare volume across assets to identify active markets
- Volume trends indicate changing market interest

### Funding rate analysis

**Carry cost calculation:**
- Funding rates determine the cost of holding positions
- Positive funding means longs pay shorts
- Negative funding means shorts pay longs

**Market sentiment:**
- Persistent positive funding indicates bullish sentiment
- Persistent negative funding indicates bearish sentiment
- Funding rate changes signal sentiment shifts

### Price discovery insights

**Oracle vs mark price:**
- Premium indicates market's view vs external prices
- Persistent premiums suggest strong directional bias
- Premium convergence indicates arbitrage efficiency

**Price impact assessment:**
- Impact prices help estimate execution costs
- Compare impact across assets for relative liquidity
- Use for optimal order sizing and execution strategies

### Risk management applications

**Leverage constraints:**
- Max leverage varies by asset based on volatility and liquidity
- Isolated margin requirements for certain assets
- Use constraints for position sizing and risk management

**Volatility indicators:**
- Price changes from previous day show daily volatility
- Premium volatility indicates market uncertainty
- Impact price spreads reflect intraday volatility
