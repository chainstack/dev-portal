<Info>
This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available on Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support them yet — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

Returns the raw transaction data by block hash and transaction index. Use this method to retrieve the RLP-encoded raw transaction from a specific position within a known block.

## Parameters

* `blockHash` (string, required) — The 32-byte hash of the block
* `transactionIndex` (string, required) — The index position of the transaction in the block (hex string)

## Returns

Returns the raw transaction data as a hex-encoded string, or `null` if the block or transaction is not found.

The raw transaction data is RLP-encoded and includes all transaction fields in their original binary format.

<Note>
Transaction indices start from 0x0. Use hex format for the index parameter (e.g., "0x0" for the first transaction, "0x1" for the second).
</Note>

## Use cases

* **Block analysis** — Extract raw transactions from specific blocks
* **Transaction reconstruction** — Rebuild transactions from block data
* **Cross-chain verification** — Verify transaction encoding across networks
* **Archive tools** — Efficiently process transactions by block position
* **Forensic investigation** — Analyze transaction ordering within blocks
* **Data migration** — Transfer transaction data between systems
