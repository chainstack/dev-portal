## Parameters

* `blockHash` (string, required) — The 32-byte hash of the block
* `transactionIndex` (string, required) — The index position of the transaction in the block (hex string)

## Returns

Returns the raw transaction data as a hex-encoded string, or `null` if the block or transaction is not found.

The raw transaction data is RLP-encoded and includes all transaction fields in their original binary format.

<Note>
Transaction indices start from 0x0. Use hex format for the index parameter (e.g., "0x0" for the first transaction, "0x1" for the second).
