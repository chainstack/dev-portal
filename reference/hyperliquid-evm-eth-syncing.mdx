## Parameters

This method takes no parameters.

## Returns

Returns the synchronization status. On Hyperliquid, this is always `false`, indicating the node is fully synchronized.

<Note>
On Hyperliquid, this method always returns `false`. The network architecture ensures nodes are always synchronized, so there's no syncing state.

## cURL example

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_syncing","params":[],"id":1}' \
  https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/4f8d8f4040bdacd1577bff8058438274/evm
```

Example response:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":false}
```

## Use cases

* **EVM compatibility** — Maintain compatibility with standard Ethereum JSON-RPC interface
* **Application initialization** — Check node readiness (always ready on Hyperliquid)
* **Health monitoring** — Verify node status in monitoring systems
* **Cross-chain compatibility** — Support applications that check sync status across different networks
