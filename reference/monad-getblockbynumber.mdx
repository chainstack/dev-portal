## Parameters

* `quantity or tag` — the integer of a block number encoded as hexadecimal, or the string `latest`, `earliest`, or `pending`.
* `boolean` — if `true`, returns the full transaction objects; if `false`, returns only the hashes of the transactions.

## Response

* `result` — the block object, or `null` when no block was found:
  * `number` — the block number
  * `hash` — the block hash
  * `parentHash` — hash of the parent block
  * `nonce` — hash of the proof-of-work
  * `sha3Uncles` — SHA3 of the uncles data
  * `logsBloom` — the bloom filter for the logs
  * `transactionsRoot` — the root of the transaction trie
  * `stateRoot` — the root of the final state trie
  * `receiptsRoot` — the root of the receipts trie
  * `miner` — the address of the beneficiary
  * `difficulty` — integer of the difficulty
  * `totalDifficulty` — total difficulty of the chain until this block
  * `extraData` — extra data field
  * `size` — size of this block in bytes
  * `gasLimit` — maximum gas allowed in this block
  * `gasUsed` — total gas used by all transactions
  * `timestamp` — the unix timestamp for when the block was collated
  * `transactions` — array of transaction objects or hashes
  * `uncles` — array of uncle hashes

## `eth_getBlockByNumber` code examples

<CodeGroup>
```javascript ethers.js
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL");

async function getBlock() {
  const block = await provider.getBlock("latest");
  console.log(block);
}

getBlock();
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3

node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL"

web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url))
block = web3.eth.get_block('latest')
print(block)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Use case

A practical use case for `eth_getBlockByNumber` is retrieving block data for analysis, such as examining transaction volume, gas usage patterns, or timestamps for specific blocks.
