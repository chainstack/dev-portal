## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"userFillsByTime"` to retrieve user fills by time range.
* `user` (string, required) — Address in 42-character hexadecimal format; e.g. 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000.
* `startTime` (integer, required) — Start time in milliseconds, inclusive.
* `endTime` (integer, optional) — End time in milliseconds, inclusive. Defaults to current time.
* `aggregateByTime` (boolean, optional) — When true, partial fills are combined when a crossing order gets filled by multiple different resting orders. Resting orders filled by multiple crossing orders will not be aggregated.

## Response

The response is an array of fill objects within the specified time range, with each fill containing detailed trade information:

### Fill data structure

Each fill object contains the following fields:

**Core trade data:**
- `coin` — Asset identifier (simple names like "BTC", "ETH" for perpetuals; spot format like "@107" for spot trades)
- `px` — Fill price as a string for precision
- `sz` — Fill size (quantity traded)
- `side` — Trade side: "A" for Ask/Sell, "B" for Bid/Buy
- `time` — Fill timestamp in milliseconds
- `oid` — Order ID that generated this fill
- `tid` — Unique trade ID

**Position and P&L data:**
- `startPosition` — Position size before this fill
- `dir` — Trade direction (e.g., "Open Long", "Close Short", "Buy", "Sell")
- `closedPnl` — Realized profit/loss from this fill
- `crossed` — Boolean indicating if this was a crossing order

**Fee and transaction data:**
- `fee` — Trading fee paid for this fill
- `feeToken` — Token used to pay the fee (typically "USDC")
- `builderFee` — Builder fee (optional, only present if non-zero)
- `hash` — Transaction hash for blockchain verification

### Time range filtering

**Time parameters:**
- `startTime` — Inclusive start timestamp in milliseconds
- `endTime` — Inclusive end timestamp (optional, defaults to current time)
- Time range can span any period within the available data window

**Data availability:**
- Only the 10,000 most recent fills are available
- Older fills beyond this limit are not accessible
- Maximum 2000 fills returned per response

### Pagination and limits

**Response limits:**
- Maximum 2000 fills per response
- Results are ordered by time (most recent first)
- For larger time ranges, multiple requests may be needed

**Pagination strategy:**
- Use the `time` field of the last returned fill as the new `endTime`
- Subtract 1 millisecond to avoid duplicate results
- Continue until no more fills are returned

### Asset identification

**Perpetual contracts:**
- Use simple asset names: "BTC", "ETH", "AVAX", "SOL"
- Represent standard perpetual futures contracts

**Spot markets:**
- Use indexed format: "@107", "@1", etc.
- Index corresponds to the spot pair position in the universe
- Some assets may have remapped names in user interfaces
