<Info>
This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available on Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support them yet — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

Returns the receipt of a transaction by its hash, containing execution results, gas usage, event logs, and transaction status. Use this to verify transaction execution and extract contract events.

## Parameters

* `transactionHash` (string, required) — The 32-byte hash of the transaction

## Returns

Returns a transaction receipt object, or `null` if the transaction is not found or still pending.

**Transaction receipt:**
- `transactionHash` — Hash of the transaction
- `transactionIndex` — Index in the block (hex string)
- `blockHash` — Hash of containing block
- `blockNumber` — Number of containing block (hex string)
- `from` — Sender address
- `to` — Receiver address (null for contract creation)
- `gasUsed` — Actual gas used (hex string)
- `cumulativeGasUsed` — Total gas used in block up to this transaction (hex string)
- `contractAddress` — Created contract address (null if not contract creation)
- `logs` — Array of event logs
- `status` — Transaction status (`0x0` for failure, `0x1` for success)
- `effectiveGasPrice` — Actual gas price paid (hex string)
- `type` — Transaction type (hex string)

**Log object:**
- `address` — Contract address that emitted the log
- `topics` — Array of indexed event parameters
- `data` — Non-indexed event parameters

<Note>
Transaction receipts are only available for mined transactions. Pending transactions return `null`.
</Note>

## Use cases

* **Transaction verification** — Confirm transaction execution and success status
* **Event extraction** — Process smart contract events and logs
* **Gas analysis** — Analyze transaction costs and gas usage
* **Contract deployment** — Verify contract creation and get addresses
* **Wallet applications** — Display transaction results to users
* **DeFi protocols** — Monitor protocol events and state changes
