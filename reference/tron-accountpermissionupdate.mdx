## Parameters

* `owner_address` — the account address whose permissions are being updated
* `owner` — optional object containing owner permission settings with threshold and keys
* `witness` — optional object containing witness permission settings with threshold and keys  
* `actives` — optional array of active permission objects with threshold, operations, and keys
* `visible` — optional boolean parameter. When set to `true`, addresses are in base58 format. Default is `false`.

## Response

* `visible` — indicates the address format used in the response
* `txID` — the transaction hash
* `raw_data` — raw transaction data including:
  * `contract` — array containing the permission update contract
  * `ref_block_bytes` — reference block bytes
  * `ref_block_hash` — reference block hash  
  * `expiration` — transaction expiration timestamp
  * `timestamp` — transaction creation timestamp
* `raw_data_hex` — hexadecimal representation of the raw transaction

## Use case

The `wallet/accountpermissionupdate` method is used for:

* Setting up multi-signature accounts with custom permission structures
* Modifying existing account permissions and thresholds
* Managing witness permissions for Super Representative accounts
* Implementing advanced security models for institutional accounts

Note: The returned transaction must be signed and broadcast to complete the permission update.

## curl example

Provide concrete keys and a valid operations bitmask. The example below builds an unsigned permission update transaction that the node can parse. Replace the sample addresses with your own and sign the returned transaction before broadcasting.

```shell Shell
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://tron-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/95e61622bf6a8af293978377718e3b77/wallet/accountpermissionupdate' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "owner_address": "TZ4UXDV5ZhNW7fb2AMSbgfAEZ7hWsnYS2g",
    "owner": {
      "type": 0,
      "permission_name": "owner",
      "threshold": 1,
      "keys": [
        { "address": "TZ4UXDV5ZhNW7fb2AMSbgfAEZ7hWsnYS2g", "weight": 1 }
      ]
    },
    "actives": [
      {
        "type": 2,
        "permission_name": "active",
        "threshold": 1,
        "operations": "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF",
        "keys": [
          { "address": "TZ4UXDV5ZhNW7fb2AMSbgfAEZ7hWsnYS2g", "weight": 1 }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "visible": true
  }'
```

<Info>
- `operations` must be a 32‑byte hex string (64 hex chars) representing the allowed operations bitmask.
- Each `keys` entry requires an `address` and `weight`. The sum of weights for a permission must be greater than or equal to its `threshold`.
- Use base58 addresses with `visible: true`, or hex addresses with `visible: false`.
