## Parameters

* None

## Response

* If syncing:
  + `startingBlock`: The block number where syncing started.
  + `currentBlock`: The current block number where the node is synced to.
  + `highestBlock`: The estimated highest block number to sync to.
* If not syncing, returns `false`.

## Use case

This method is useful for monitoring the progress of a node's synchronization with the network, especially after the node has been offline or is catching up with the blockchain. It helps in determining whether the node is fully synced and ready to interact with the network without any data inconsistencies.
