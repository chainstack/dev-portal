## Use case

A possible use case for the `getMasterchainInfo` method in TON is for applications that need to monitor or sync with the current state of the TON blockchain. This method can be used to:

1. Track the latest block in the masterchain for synchronization purposes.
2. Verify the current state of the blockchain against a known state.
3. Monitor the progress of the masterchain in terms of block sequence numbers.
4. Obtain necessary information for validating and processing transactions.
