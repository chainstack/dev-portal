## Parameters

* `transactionHash` (string, required) — The 32-byte hash of the transaction

## Returns

Returns the raw transaction data as a hex-encoded string, or `null` if the transaction is not found.

<Note>
Raw transaction data can be decoded using RLP decoding libraries to extract individual transaction fields like nonce, gas price, gas limit, recipient, value, and signature components.
