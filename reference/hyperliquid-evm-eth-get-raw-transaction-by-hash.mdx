## Parameters

* `transactionHash` (string, required) — The 32-byte hash of the transaction

## Returns

Returns the raw transaction data as a hex-encoded string, or `null` if the transaction is not found.

The raw transaction data is RLP-encoded and includes all transaction fields in their original binary format.

<Note>
Raw transaction data can be decoded using RLP decoding libraries to extract individual transaction fields like nonce, gas price, gas limit, recipient, value, and signature components.

## Use cases

* **Transaction broadcasting** — Re-broadcast transactions to other networks
* **Forensic analysis** — Analyze transaction structure and encoding
* **Cross-chain bridges** — Verify transaction format across different networks
* **Development tools** — Debug transaction encoding and decoding
* **Archive services** — Store transactions in their original format
* **Signature verification** — Extract and verify transaction signatures
