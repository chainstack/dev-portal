title: eth_call | Monad
openapi: /openapi/monad_node_api/execute_transactions/eth_call.json POST /
---

Monad API method that executes a new message call immediately without creating a transaction on the blockchain. This is useful for reading data from smart contracts or simulating transactions.

<Note>
**Monad-specific behavior**:
- Calls reliant on old state (with an old block number) may fail, because full nodes do not provide access to arbitrary historic state.
- Does not accept EIP-4844 (blob) transaction type, as EIP-4844 is not supported on Monad.

## Parameters

* `object` — the transaction call object:
  * `from` (optional) — address the transaction is sent from
  * `to` — address the transaction is directed to
  * `gas` (optional) — gas provided for the call
  * `gasPrice` (optional) — gas price for the call
  * `value` (optional) — value sent with the call
  * `data` (optional) — hash of the method signature and encoded parameters
* `quantity or tag` — integer block number, or the string `latest`, `earliest`, or `pending`

## Response

* `result` — the return value of the executed contract call.

```javascript ethers.js
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL");

async function callContract() {
  // Call name() on Wrapped Monad (WMON) contract
  const result = await provider.call({
    to: "0x760AfE86e5de5fa0Ee542fc7B7B713e1c5425701",
    data: "0x06fdde03" // name()
  });
  console.log(result);
}

callContract();
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3

node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL"

web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url))

# Call name() on Wrapped Monad (WMON) contract
result = web3.eth.call({
    'to': '0x760AfE86e5de5fa0Ee542fc7B7B713e1c5425701',
    'data': '0x06fdde03' # name()
})
print(result.hex())
```

## Use case

A practical use case for `eth_call` is reading data from smart contracts, such as token balances, contract state variables, or simulating complex transactions before sending them.
