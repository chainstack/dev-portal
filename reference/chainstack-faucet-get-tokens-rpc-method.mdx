Chainstack API method to request Ethereum or BNB Smart Chain Testnet funds. Developers use testnet funds for various purposes, primarily to test and develop decentralized applications (DApps), smart contracts, and other blockchain-based projects within a safe and controlled environment.

<Note>
You can also request funds directly from the [Chainstack Faucet](https://faucet.chainstack.com) page.
</Note>


## Path parameters

* `chain` — the test network you want to receive funds on.
  + `hoodi` — receive testnet ETH on Hoodi.
  + `sepolia` — receive testnet ETH on Sepolia.
  + `holesky` — receive testnet ETH on Holesky.
  + `bnb-testnet` — receive testnet BNB.
  + `amoy` — receive testnet POL on Amoy testnet.
  + `ton-testnet` — receive TON for TON testnet.
  + `zksync-testnet` — receive testnet ETH on zkSync.
  + `scroll-sepolia-testnet` — receive testnet ETH on Scroll Sepolia.

<Warning>
**Spam protection system**

To safeguard against misuse, the Chainstack faucet implements two key checks before disbursing funds:

1. The requesting address must have a minimum balance of 0.08 ETH on the Ethereum mainnet.
2. The address should have a history of holding ETH on the mainnet; it should not have been recently empty.

These precautions help us maintain the integrity of the Chainstack faucet, ensuring fair and equitable access for all users.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Faucet API base URL**

`https://api.chainstack.com/v1/faucet/{chain}`
</Note>


## Body parameters

* `address` — the address that will receive the funds.

## Response

* `url`— the block explorer URL, including the transaction hash, to monitor the status.

## Request funds from this page

You can already try this API from this page by doing the following:

1. [Get your API key](/reference/platform-api-getting-started#create-api-key) and paste it into the **Bearer** field in the **AUTHENTICATION** section.
2. At the bottom of the page, select which network you want to receive funds from.
3. At the bottom of the page, paste your Ethereum address in the **address** field.

## Code examples

The Faucet API is a great option for developers who don't want to spend time hunting for testnet tokens.

Here's an example of a script that automatically refills your wallet by calling the Chainstack Faucet API every 24 hours, ensuring a seamless daily refill.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
// npm i axios

const axios = require('axios');

// API config
const chain = 'sepolia' // goerli
const address = 'YOUR_ADDRESS';

const apiUrl = `https://api.chainstack.com/v1/faucet/${chain}`;
const apiKey = 'YOUR_CHAINSTACK_API_KEY';

const fillWallet = async () => {
    console.log(`Sending faucet request for address ${address}`)
  try {
    const response = await axios.post(apiUrl, { address }, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
    });

    console.log('API call successful:', response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error making API call:', error.response.data);
  }

  // Schedule the next API call in 24 hours (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 milliseconds)
  setTimeout(makeApiCall, 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
};

// Make the first API call immediately
fillWallet();
```

```python Python
# pip install requests

import requests
import time

# API config
chain = 'sepolia'  # goerli
address = 'YOUR_ADDRESS'

api_url = f'https://api.chainstack.com/v1/faucet/{chain}'
api_key = 'YOUR_CHAINSTACK_API_KEY'


def fill_wallet():
    print(f'Sending faucet request for address {address}')
    try:
        response = requests.post(
            api_url,
            json={'address': address},
            headers={
                'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            },
        )

        print('API call successful:', response.json())
    except Exception as error:
        print('Error making API call:', error)

    # Schedule the next API call in 24 hours (24 * 60 * 60 seconds)
    time.sleep(24 * 60 * 60)


# Make the first API call immediately
while True:
    fill_wallet()
```

## Use cases

Here are some use cases testnet funds are used for:

* Smart contract development — with testnet funds, developers can deploy and interact with smart contracts, finding and fixing any issues before moving to the mainnet, where the real money is involved.
* Testing DApps and infrastructure — testnet funds allow developers to try out transactions, see how user interfaces work, and check the overall functionality of their DApps and blockchain components without risking real assets.
* Trying out new features — testnets are perfect for exploring and testing new features or updates to blockchain protocols and applications. It's like a sandbox where developers can play around and validate their ideas before taking them live on the mainnet.
* Stress testing and scalability — developers use testnet funds to put their DApps or smart contracts through the wringer, seeing how they perform under various conditions and loads. This helps them spot any issues and fix them before going live.
* Learning and training — testnet funds create a risk-free space for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts to learn about blockchain technology, smart contracts, and DApps. It's a great way to build expertise and understanding in the field.
