<Info>
You can only use this endpoint on the official Hyperliquid public API. It is not available through Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support it yet. See [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `info` endpoint with `type: "delegatorRewards"` retrieves comprehensive staking rewards history for a specific user on the Hyperliquid exchange. This endpoint provides detailed historical data about rewards earned from delegation and validator commission, including timestamps and reward amounts, enabling thorough analysis of staking reward performance and validator earnings.

## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"delegatorRewards"` to retrieve staking rewards.
* `user` (string, required) — Address in 42-character hexadecimal format; e.g. 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000.

## Response

The response is an array of staking reward events, ordered chronologically. Each event represents rewards earned from either delegation or validator commission activities.

### Response structure

Each reward event contains:

**Event timing:**
- `time` — Timestamp of the reward event in milliseconds since Unix epoch
- Indicates when the rewards were distributed or earned

**Reward source:**
- `source` — Source of the reward, indicating the type of staking activity
- `"delegation"` — Rewards earned from delegating tokens to validators
- `"commission"` — Commission earned from operating as a validator

**Reward amount:**
- `totalAmount` — Total amount of rewards received as a string for precision
- Represents the quantity of tokens earned from the staking activity

### Reward source types

**Delegation rewards (`source: "delegation"`):**
- Rewards earned by delegating tokens to validators
- Proportional to the amount staked and validator performance
- Regular rewards distributed based on network parameters
- Represents passive staking income

**Commission rewards (`source: "commission"`):**
- Commission earned from operating as a validator
- Percentage of rewards from users who delegate to this validator
- Only applicable if the user operates a validator node
- Represents active validator income

### Data interpretation

**Reward frequency:**
- Events show when rewards are distributed
- Frequency depends on network reward distribution schedule
- Regular patterns indicate consistent staking participation

**Reward amounts:**
- Amounts vary based on staked quantity and network conditions
- Delegation rewards scale with delegation amount
- Commission rewards scale with total delegated stake to validator

**Performance tracking:**
- Historical rewards enable performance analysis
- Compare rewards across different time periods
- Assess the effectiveness of staking strategies

## Staking rewards analysis

### Reward performance metrics

**Total rewards calculation:**
- Sum all reward amounts to calculate total earnings
- Separate delegation rewards from commission rewards
- Track reward accumulation over time

**Reward rate analysis:**
- Calculate average rewards per time period
- Analyze reward rate trends and variations
- Compare performance across different validators

**Yield calculation:**
- Calculate annualized percentage yield (APY)
- Compare staking yields to other investment options
- Assess risk-adjusted returns from staking

### Validator performance assessment

**Delegation reward consistency:**
- Analyze consistency of delegation rewards over time
- Identify periods of high or low reward performance
- Correlate rewards with validator uptime and performance

**Commission earnings (for validators):**
- Track commission earnings from delegators
- Analyze growth in commission over time
- Assess validator business performance

### Reward optimization insights

**Staking strategy evaluation:**
- Compare rewards from different validators
- Identify optimal delegation strategies
- Analyze the impact of delegation timing on rewards

**Compound growth analysis:**
- Track how rewards contribute to overall staking position
- Analyze the effect of reward compounding
- Optimize reward reinvestment strategies

### Risk and return analysis

**Reward volatility:**
- Analyze variability in reward amounts over time
- Assess reward stability across different market conditions
- Identify factors affecting reward consistency

**Diversification benefits:**
- Compare rewards from multiple validators
- Analyze risk reduction through validator diversification
- Optimize validator selection for risk-adjusted returns
