title: eth_getTransactionByHash | Monad
openapi: /openapi/monad_node_api/transaction_info/eth_getTransactionByHash.json POST /
---

Monad API method that returns information about a transaction by transaction hash. This method allows you to retrieve detailed information about a specific transaction.

<Note>
**Monad-specific behavior**: This method does not return pending transactions. It will only return transactions that have been included in a block. If you query for a transaction that is still in the mempool, the method will return `null`.
