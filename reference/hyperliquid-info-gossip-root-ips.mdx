openapi: /openapi/hyperliquid_node_api/info_gossip_root_ips.json post /info
---

The `info` endpoint with `type: "gossipRootIps"` retrieves a list of recently available seed peer IP addresses for non-validators looking to connect to the Hyperliquid network. This endpoint provides reliable peer addresses that can be used as seed peers for node synchronization and network connectivity.

## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) â€” The request type. Must be `"gossipRootIps"` to retrieve the list of seed peer IP addresses.

## Response

The response is an array of IP addresses (strings) representing recently available seed peers that can be used for network connectivity.

## Example request

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "gossipRootIps"}' \
  https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/info
```

## Example response

```json
[
  "54.199.122.133",
  "116.199.229.233",
  "54.168.150.28",
  "35.190.230.32",
  "13.230.48.38",
  "218.33.8.227",
  "35.72.88.240",
  "45.76.206.35",
  "54.65.106.241",
  "18.180.228.50",
  "35.79.116.97",
  "13.158.102.147",
  "52.198.152.3",
  "43.207.77.116",
  "57.181.193.239",
  "52.193.108.65",
  "54.64.2.87"
]
```

## Use case

The `info` endpoint with `type: "gossipRootIps"` is particularly useful for:

* Non-validators setting up new nodes who need reliable seed peers for initial synchronization
* Node operators looking to expand their peer connectivity with known good peers
* Applications that need to dynamically discover active network peers
* Network monitoring tools that track peer availability and distribution
* Backup peer discovery when primary seed nodes are unavailable

This endpoint ensures that new nodes joining the network can quickly find active peers without relying on hardcoded IP addresses that may become stale over time.
