```python Python
from hyperliquid.exchange import Exchange
from hyperliquid.utils import constants
import eth_account

# Initialize with your private key
account = eth_account.Account.from_key("0x...")
exchange = Exchange(account, constants.MAINNET_API_URL)

# Update cross leverage for BTC to 10x
update_result = exchange.update_leverage(
    coin="BTC",
    is_cross=True,
    leverage=10
)

# Update isolated leverage for ETH to 5x
update_isolated = exchange.update_leverage(
    coin="ETH",
    is_cross=False,
    leverage=5
)

print(update_result)
```

## Response example

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "response": {
    "type": "default"
  }
}
```

## Important considerations

* **Existing positions** — Leverage changes affect margin requirements for existing positions
* **Liquidation risk** — Increasing leverage increases liquidation risk
* **Available margin** — Ensure sufficient margin before increasing leverage
* **Asset limits** — Each asset has different maximum leverage limits

## Use cases

* **Risk adjustment** — Dynamically adjust risk based on market conditions
* **Capital efficiency** — Optimize margin usage across positions
* **Strategy implementation** — Set appropriate leverage for different trading strategies
* **Position management** — Adjust leverage before opening new positions

<Note>
Leverage is only checked when opening a position. After opening, monitor your positions to avoid liquidation as leverage effectively changes with unrealized PnL.
</Note>

<Warning>
Increasing leverage on existing positions increases liquidation risk. Always ensure you have sufficient margin to support the new leverage level.
