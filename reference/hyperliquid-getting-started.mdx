## What is the Hyperliquid protocol

Hyperliquid is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain that focuses on providing a deep liquidity DEX for spot trading and for perpetual trading. The Hyperliquid founder calls it [the AWS of liquidity](https://mobile.x.com/chameleon_jeff/status/1841392573199585291).

Hyperliquid uses a custom consensus algorithm called HyperBFT, which is inspired by Hotstuff and its successors.

Hyperliquid state execution operates through two main components:

- HyperCore — provides fully onchain perpetual futures and spot order books with one-block finality. HyperCore supports 200,000 orders per second, with throughput continuously improving through node software optimization.
- HyperEVM — brings Ethereum-compatible smart contract functionality to Hyperliquid. This component makes HyperCore's liquidity and financial primitives available as permissionless building blocks for developers.

Chainstack supports both HyperCore and HyperEVM. For the full list of methods and the available endpoints, see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods).

## What is the Hyperliquid API

The Hyperliquid API allows developers to interact with the Hyperliquid DEX to build trading applications, analytics tools, and portfolio management systems.

To read market data and execute trades on Hyperliquid, an application must connect to a Hyperliquid node endpoint.

The Hyperliquid API implements both REST endpoints and WebSocket connections for real-time data streaming, providing comprehensive access to trading functionality, market data, and account management.

## Limits

Some endpoint methods can only be used on the official Hyperliquid public API. These endpoints are not available through Chainstack, as the open-source node implementation does not support them yet.

Endpoints that are only available through the official Hyperliquid API are marked with a note in this Hyperliquid API reference.

## How to start using the Hyperliquid API

To use the Hyperliquid API, you need access to a Hyperliquid node endpoint.

Follow these steps to sign up on Chainstack, deploy a Hyperliquid node, and find your endpoint credentials:

1. [Sign up with Chainstack](https://console.chainstack.com/user/account/create).
2. [Deploy a node](/docs/manage-your-networks#join-a-public-network).
3. [View node access and credentials](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).

Now you are ready to connect to the Hyperliquid blockchain and use the Hyperliquid API to build trading applications.
