title: 'subscribe "logs" | Gnosis'
---

Gnosis Chain web3.js subscription equivalent to [eth\_newFilter](/reference/gnosis-newfilter). `subscribe("logs")` allows developers to subscribe to real-time updates about new event logs on the Gnosis Chain; the application will receive notifications whenever new logs matching the filter are emitted.

## Parameters

* `string` — a keyword identifying the type of event to subscribe to, `logs` in this case.

* `object` — (optional) The subscription options:

  * `fromBlock` — an integer that specifies the starting block number from which the logs should be fetched. `null` by default.
  * `address` — the contract address from which the logs should be fetched. It can be a single address or an array of addresses.
  * `topics` — an array of `DATA` topics. The event topics for which the logs should be fetched. It can be a single topic or an array of topics.

* `function` — (optional) a callback function that will be called every time a new event of the specified type is received. This function takes two parameters: `error` and `result`. The error parameter contains any error that occurred while subscribing to the event, and the result parameter contains the data for the event that was received.

## Response

* `array` — an array of log objects that match the specified filter:

  * `address` — the contract address from which the event originated.
  * `topics` — an array of 32-byte data fields containing indexed event parameters.
  * `data` — the non-indexed data that was emitted along with the event.
  * `blocknumber` — the block number in which the event was included. `null` if it is pending.
  * `transactionhash` — the hash of the transaction that triggered the event. `null` if pending.
  * `transactionindex` — the integer index of the transaction within the block's list of transactions. `null` if it is pending.
  * `blockhash` — the hash of the block in which the event was included. `null` if it is pending.
  * `logindex` — the integer identifying the index of the event within the block's list of events. `null` if pending.
  * `removed` — the boolean value indicating if the event was removed from the blockchain due to a chain reorganization. `True` if the log was removed. `False` if it is a valid log.

## `subscribe("logs")` code example

<Info>
  Note that web3.js subscriptions require a WebSocket connection.
</Info>

Use the [event emitter instances](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-subscribe.html#eth-subscription-return) to attach event listeners to the subscription object:

* `data` — activates for each new syncing event.
* `error` — activates if an error is detected during the subscription.
* `connected` — activates after the subscription is successfully connected and returns the subscription ID.
* `unsubscribe` — unsubscribes the subscription and returns `true` if successful.

  ```javascript index.js
  const Web3 = require("web3");
  const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_WSS_URL";
  const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

  // Only log transfer events from the WMATIC smart contract.
  const logsFilter = {

  }

  async function subscribeToLogs() {
      try {
          // Create a new subscription to the 'pendingTransactions' event
          const subscription = await web3.eth.subscribe('logs', logsFilter);

          // Attach event listeners to the subscription object
          subscription.on('connected', handleConnected);
          subscription.on('data', handleLogs);
          subscription.on('error', handleError);
      } catch (error) {
          console.error(`Error subscribing to new sync: ${error}`);
      }
  }

  /* Fallback functions to react to the different events */

  // Event listener that logs a message when the subscription is connected
  function handleConnected(subscriptionId) {
      console.log(`New subscription: ${subscriptionId}`);
  }

  // Event listener that logs the filtered events
  async function handleLogs(logs) {
      console.log(logs)
  }

  // Event listener that logs any errors that occur
  function handleError(error) {
      console.error(`Error receiving new blocks: ${error}`);
  }

  subscribeToLogs();
  ```

## Use case

A practical use case for `subscribe("logs")` is a DApp that continuously listens for new specific event logs and isolates certain fields for analytics purposes. This is useful, for example, to track events about a specific ERC-721 token.
