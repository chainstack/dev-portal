---

The `eth_call` JSON-RPC method executes a new message call immediately without creating a transaction on the blockchain. This method is essential for reading data from smart contracts, calling view functions, and retrieving blockchain state without modifying it or paying gas fees.

## Parameters

The method takes two parameters:

1. **Transaction call object** - Contains the call details
2. **Block parameter** - Specifies which block state to use

### Transaction call object

* `to` (string, required) — The contract address to call
* `data` (string, optional) — The hash of the method signature and encoded parameters
* `from` (string, optional) — The address the call is made from
* `gas` (string, optional) — Gas limit for the call execution
* `gasPrice` (string, optional) — Gas price for the call
* `value` (string, optional) — Value sent with the call

### Block parameter

* Block identifier: `"latest"` (only the latest block is supported on Hyperliquid)

## Response

The method returns the result of the contract call as a hexadecimal string.

### Response structure

**Call result:**
- `result` — The return value of the executed contract method as a hexadecimal string

### Data interpretation

**Return value format:**
- Results are returned as hexadecimal strings
- Decode according to the contract function's return type
- Use ABI decoding libraries for complex return types
- Simple values like uint256 can be converted directly from hex

**Common patterns:**
- `0x` prefix indicates hexadecimal format
- Leading zeros are included in the response
- Empty results return `0x`
- Failed calls may return error data

## Smart contract interaction

### Function calls

**Method signature encoding:**
- Function selector: First 4 bytes of keccak256 hash of function signature
- Parameters: ABI-encoded according to Ethereum standards
- Example: `totalSupply()` → `0x18160ddd`

**Parameter encoding:**
- Use ABI encoding for function parameters
- Combine function selector with encoded parameters
- Tools like web3.js, ethers.js handle encoding automatically

### Common use cases

**ERC-20 token calls:**
- `totalSupply()` → `0x18160ddd`
- `balanceOf(address)` → `0x70a08231` + encoded address
- `allowance(address,address)` → `0xdd62ed3e` + encoded addresses

**Contract state queries:**
- Read public variables and mappings
- Call view and pure functions
- Check contract configuration and parameters
- Validate contract state before transactions

## Development patterns

### Error handling

**Call failures:**
- Calls can fail due to reverts, out-of-gas, or invalid data
- Check for error responses and handle appropriately
- Use try-catch patterns for robust error handling
- Validate contract addresses and function signatures

**Gas considerations:**
- Specify gas limit to prevent out-of-gas errors
- Use reasonable gas limits for complex calls
- Monitor gas usage for optimization opportunities
- Consider gas costs for view function complexity

### Optimization strategies

**Batch calls:**
- Group multiple calls to reduce network overhead
- Use multicall contracts for efficient batch operations
- Cache results when appropriate to reduce API calls
- Implement intelligent caching based on latest state

**State consistency:**
- Only the latest block is supported on Hyperliquid
- All calls are made against the current blockchain state
- Handle potential state changes between calls
- Implement retry logic for temporary failures

## Use cases

The `eth_call` method is essential for applications that need to:

* **Smart contract interaction**: Read data from smart contracts without modifying state
* **Token information**: Query ERC-20/ERC-721 token balances, supplies, and metadata
* **DeFi protocols**: Interact with DeFi contracts to read prices, liquidity, and positions
* **Contract validation**: Validate contract state and parameters before transactions
* **Data aggregation**: Aggregate data from multiple contracts efficiently
* **Portfolio tracking**: Track user balances and positions across multiple contracts
* **Price oracles**: Read price data from oracle contracts and price feeds
* **Governance systems**: Query governance proposals, voting power, and delegation status
* **NFT platforms**: Read NFT metadata, ownership, and marketplace information
* **Gaming applications**: Query game state, player stats, and in-game assets
* **Analytics platforms**: Build analytics tools that read blockchain state data
* **Wallet applications**: Display user balances, allowances, and contract interactions
* **Trading interfaces**: Read market data, order books, and trading parameters
* **Lending protocols**: Query lending rates, collateral ratios, and liquidation data
* **Staking platforms**: Read staking rewards, validator information, and delegation data
* **Cross-chain bridges**: Verify bridge state and cross-chain transaction status
* **Audit tools**: Analyze contract state for security audits and compliance
* **Development tools**: Build debugging and testing tools for smart contract development
* **Monitoring systems**: Monitor contract state changes and trigger alerts
* **Integration services**: Integrate blockchain data with external systems and databases
* **Educational platforms**: Create educational tools that demonstrate blockchain concepts
* **Research tools**: Conduct blockchain research and analysis using contract data
* **Compliance tools**: Ensure regulatory compliance by monitoring contract interactions
* **Risk management**: Assess risks by analyzing contract state and parameters
* **Arbitrage bots**: Identify arbitrage opportunities by reading market data from contracts

This method provides fundamental smart contract interaction capabilities, enabling robust and efficient blockchain applications on the Hyperliquid EVM platform.

<Note>
On Hyperliquid, `eth_call` only supports the latest block. Historical state queries are not supported in the default RPC implementation.
