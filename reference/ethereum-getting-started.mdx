## What is the Ethereum protocol?

Ethereum, launched in 2015, is a decentralized and open-source blockchain network that provides a platform for developers to build decentralized applications for diverse purposes. Ethereum relies on a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, and one of Ethereum's most critical features is its smart contract functionality, which empowers developers to create self-executing programs, automating the enforcement of contractual terms and conditions.

## What is the Ethereum API?

The Ethereum API allows developers to communicate with the Ethereum blockchain to build applications.

Chainstack Ethereum nodes provide execution layer API and consensus layer API (aka Beacon Chain API).

An application must connect to an Ethereum RPC node to read data from and send transactions to the Ethereum blockchain.

When communicating with an Ethereum RPC node, the Ethereum client implements a JSON-RPC specification, a communication protocol allowing one to make remote calls and execute them as if they were made locally.

## How to start using the Ethereum API

You need access to an Ethereum RPC node to use the Ethereum API.

Follow these steps to sign up on Chainstack, deploy an Ethereum RPC node, and find your endpoint credentials:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    [Sign up with Chainstack](https://console.chainstack.com/user/account/create).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    [Deploy a node](https://docs.chainstack.com/docs/manage-your-networks#join-a-public-network).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    [View node access and credentials](https://docs.chainstack.com/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).
  </Step>
</Steps>

Now, you can connect to the Ethereum blockchain and use the Ethereum API to build.
