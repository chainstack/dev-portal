This method is available on Chainstack. Not all Hyperliquid methods are available — see [Hyperliquid methods](/docs/hyperliquid-methods) for the full availability breakdown.
</Info>

The `ots_getTransactionBySenderAndNonce` JSON-RPC method retrieves a transaction hash by specifying the sender address and nonce on the Hyperliquid EVM blockchain. This Otterscan-specific method helps locate transactions when you know the sender and nonce but not the transaction hash.

## Parameters

1. **sender address** (string, required): The address that sent the transaction
2. **nonce** (integer, required): The nonce value used for the transaction

## Response

The method returns the transaction hash if found, or null if no transaction exists with the specified sender and nonce.

### Response structure

- `result` — the transaction hash (32-byte hex string), or `null` if not found

## Usage example

```shell Shell
curl -X POST https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/4f8d8f4040bdacd1577bff8058438274/evm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "ots_getTransactionBySenderAndNonce",
    "params": ["0x5555555555555555555555555555555555555555", 0],
    "id": 1
  }'
```

### Example response (transaction found)

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": "0xf94f3d2ed5b59aefb6a0e566af8e86552014d84f6ed2f38a1366dedffe723381"
}
```

### Example response (not found)

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": null
}
```

### Finding multiple transactions

To find a sequence of transactions from an address:
```javascript
// Find transactions with nonces 0 through 5
for (let nonce = 0; nonce <= 5; nonce++) {
  const params = ["0x5555555555555555555555555555555555555555", nonce];
  // Make RPC call with params
}
```

## Use cases

The `ots_getTransactionBySenderAndNonce` method is essential for:

* **Transaction recovery**: Find lost transaction hashes using sender and nonce
* **Wallet debugging**: Track down specific transactions from an account
* **Nonce management**: Verify which nonces have been used by an address
* **Transaction replacement**: Find original transactions before replacement
* **Account auditing**: Systematically review all transactions from an address
* **Support tools**: Help users find their transactions without the hash
* **Forensic analysis**: Track transaction sequences from specific accounts
* **Testing verification**: Confirm test transactions were submitted
* **MEV analysis**: Study transaction ordering and nonce patterns
* **Integration recovery**: Recover from lost transaction tracking in dApps

This method is particularly useful when debugging wallet issues or when transaction hashes weren't properly stored by an application.
