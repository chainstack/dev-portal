---

The `eth_getUncleByBlockHashAndIndex` JSON-RPC method returns information about an uncle block by block hash and uncle index position. Uncle blocks are valid blocks that were not included in the main chain but are referenced by the main chain blocks for network security.

## Parameters

1. **block_hash** (string) — The hash of the block containing the uncle
2. **uncle_index** (string) — The uncle index position as a hexadecimal string (e.g., "0x0" for the first uncle)

## Response

The method returns uncle block information or `null` if no uncle exists at the specified index.

### Response structure

**Uncle block information:**
- Returns uncle block object with header information if found
- Returns `null` if no uncle exists at the specified index
- Uncle blocks contain header information but no transaction data

### Uncle block interpretation

**Block structure:**
- Uncle blocks are valid blocks that were not included in the main chain
- They are referenced by main chain blocks to maintain network security
- Uncle blocks earn reduced rewards compared to main chain blocks

**Index positioning:**
- Uncle index starts from 0 for the first uncle in the block
- Multiple uncles can exist in a single block
- Index must be provided as hexadecimal string with "0x" prefix

## Usage example

### Basic implementation

```javascript
// Get uncle block by hash and index
const getUncleByBlockHashAndIndex = async (blockHash, uncleIndex) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://hyperliquid-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/YOUR_ENDPOINT/evm', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      method: 'eth_getUncleByBlockHashAndIndex',
      params: [blockHash, uncleIndex],
      id: 1
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.result;
};

// Check for uncles in a block
const checkBlockUncles = async (blockHash) => {
  const uncles = [];
  let index = 0;
  
  while (true) {
    const uncle = await getUncleByBlockHashAndIndex(
      blockHash, 
      `0x${index.toString(16)}`
    );
    
    if (uncle === null) {
      break;
    }
    
    uncles.push(uncle);
    index++;
  }
  
  return uncles;
};

// Usage
const blockHash = '0x2ce91ae0ed242b4b78b432a45b982fb81a414d6b04167762ed3c7446710a4b8e';
checkBlockUncles(blockHash).then(uncles => {
  console.log(`Found ${uncles.length} uncles in block`);
  uncles.forEach((uncle, i) => {
    console.log(`Uncle ${i}:`, uncle);
  });
});
```
