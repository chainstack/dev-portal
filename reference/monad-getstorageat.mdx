Monad API method that returns the value from a storage position at a given address. This method allows you to read the raw storage of smart contracts, which is useful for debugging and analyzing contract state.

## Parameters

* `data` — the 20-byte address of the storage.
* `quantity` — the position in the storage as a hexadecimal string.
* `quantity|tag` — the block number as a hexadecimal string, or one of the following block tags:
  * `latest` — the most recent block in the canonical chain
  * `earliest` — the genesis block
  * `pending` — the pending state/transactions

## Response

* `result` — the value at this storage position, encoded as a 32-byte hexadecimal string.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript ethers.js
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL");

async function getStorageAt() {
  const contractAddress = "0xAc586b65F3cd0627D2D05AdB8EF551C9d2D76E12";
  const position = "0x0"; // Storage slot 0
  const value = await provider.getStorage(contractAddress, position);
  console.log(`Storage value at position 0: ${value}`);
}

getStorageAt();
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3

node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL"

web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url))
contract_address = "0xAc586b65F3cd0627D2D05AdB8EF551C9d2D76E12"
value = web3.eth.get_storage_at(contract_address, 0)
print(f'Storage value at position 0: {value.hex()}')
```
</CodeGroup>

## Use case

A practical use case for `eth_getStorageAt` is reading private or internal state variables from smart contracts that are not exposed through public getter functions, or verifying that a contract's storage layout matches expected values during audits.
