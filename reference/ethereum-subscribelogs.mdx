title: 'subscribe ("logs") | Ethereum'
---

web3.js subscription equivalent to [eth\_newFilter](/reference/ethereum-newfilter). `subscribe("logs")` allows developers to subscribe to real-time updates about new event logs on the Ethereum blockchain; the application will receive notifications whenever new logs matching the filter are emitted.

## Parameters

* `string` — a keyword identifying the type of event to subscribe to, `logs` in this case.

* `object` — (optional) The subscription options:

  * `address` — the contract address from which the logs should be fetched. It can be a single address or an array of addresses.
  * `topics` — an array of `DATA` topics. The event topics for which the logs should be fetched. It can be a single topic or an array of topics.

* `function` — (optional) a callback function that will be called every time a new event of the specified type is received. This function takes two parameters: `error` and `result`. The error parameter contains any error that occurred while subscribing to the event, and the result parameter contains the data for the event that was received.

## Response

* `array` — an array of log objects that match the specified filter:

  * `address` — the contract address from which the event originated.
  * `topics` — an array of 32-byte data fields containing indexed event parameters.
  * `data` — the non-indexed data that was emitted along with the event.
  * `blocknumber` — the block number in which the event was included. `null` if it is pending.
  * `transactionhash` — the hash of the transaction that triggered the event. `null` if pending.
  * `transactionindex` — the integer index of the transaction within the block's list of transactions. `null` if it is pending.
  * `blockhash` — the hash of the block in which the event was included. `null` if it is pending.
  * `logindex` — the integer identifying the index of the event within the block's list of events. `null` if pending.
  * `removed` — the boolean value indicating if the event was removed from the blockchain due to a chain reorganization. `True` if the log was removed. `False` if it is a valid log.

## `subscribe("logs")` code example

<Info>
  Note that web3.js subscriptions require a WebSocket connection.
</Info>

Use the event emitter instances to attach event listeners to the subscription object:

* `data` — activates for each new syncing event:
* `error` — activates if an error is detected during the subscription.
* `unsubscribe` — unsubscribes the subscription and returns `true` if successful.

  ```javascript index.js
  const { Web3 } = require("web3");

  const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_WSS_ENDPOINT";
  const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

  // Filter for WETH transfer events
  const logsFilter = {
      address: '0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2', // WETH contract address
      topics: ['0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef'] // Transfer event signature
  };

  async function subscribeToLogs() {
    try {
      // Create a new subscription to logs with the specified filter
      const subscription = await web3.eth.subscribe('logs', logsFilter);

      console.log(`Subscription created with ID: ${subscription.id}`);

      // Attach event listeners to the subscription object for 'data' and 'error'
      subscription.on("data", handleLogs);
      subscription.on("error", handleError);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Error subscribing to new logs: ${error}`);
    }
  }

  // Event listener that logs the received log data
  function handleLogs(log) {
    console.log("New log received:", log);
  }

  // Event listener that logs any errors that occur
  function handleError(error) {
    console.error("Error when subscribing to new logs:", error);
  }

  subscribeToLogs();
  ```

## Use case

A practical use case for `subscribe("logs")` is a DApp that continuously listens for new specific event logs and isolates certain fields for analytics purposes. This is useful, for example, to only track events about a specific ERC-721 token.

The following is an implementation of this concept using `Web3.js` subscriptions, this program will only track the `Transfer` event from the [MutantApeYachtClub collection](https://etherscan.io/token/0x60e4d786628fea6478f785a6d7e704777c86a7c6) smart contract.

The `Transfer` event looks like this in the smart contract:

<CodeGroup>
  ```sol IERC721.sol
  event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 indexed tokenId);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>

</Info>

The following code will log all of the new `Transfer` events, and extract the block number. This can be useful to analyze when tokens are moved.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript index.js
  const {Web3} = require("web3");
  const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_WSS_ENDPOINT";
  const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

  // Filter for Transfer events from the MAYC smart contract
  const logsFilter = {
      address: '0x60E4d786628Fea6478F785A6d7e704777c86a7c6', // MAYC contract address
      topics: ['0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef'] // Transfer event signature
  };

  let subscription; // Declare subscription at a higher scope to allow access in unsubscribe function

  async function subscribeToLogs() {
      try {
          // Create a new subscription to logs with the specified filter
          subscription = await web3.eth.subscribe('logs', logsFilter);

          console.log(`Subscription created with ID: ${subscription.id}`);

          // Attach event listeners to the subscription object
          subscription.on('data', handleLogs);
          subscription.on('error', handleError);
      } catch (error) {
          console.error(`Error subscribing to logs: ${error}`);
      }
  }

  /* Fallback functions to react to the different events */

  // Event listener that logs the filtered events
  function handleLogs(log) {
      const block = log.blockNumber;
      console.log(`A Mutant Ape was transferred in this block: ${block}`);
  }

  // Event listener that logs any errors that occur
  function handleError(error) {
      console.error(`Error receiving logs: ${error}`);
  }

  subscribeToLogs();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This code creates a new subscription to the `logs` event using the `web3.eth.subscribe` method. This method returns a subscription object that can attach event listeners to the subscription.

The code defines two event listener functions that are attached to the subscription object: `handleLogs` and `handleError`. The `handleLogs` function is called when a new log matching the filter is emitted, then extracts the block number field and logs it to the console.

The `handleError` function is called when an error occurs, and it logs an error message.

Finally, the code calls the `subscribeToLogs` function, which creates the subscription and attaches the event listeners. When a new event log is received, the `handleLogs` function is called to extract and log the data to the console.
