## web3.js subscriptions

The [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/getting-started.html) library also offers subscription methods. web3.js subscriptions are the successors of the deprecated `web3.eth.filter` methods and provide a way for developers to receive real-time updates about events on the blockchain without constantly polling the blockchain for new data.

Subscriptions can be created using one of the following methods:

<CardGroup>
<Card title="subscribe('newBlockHeaders')" href="/reference/arbitrum-subscribenewblockheaders" icon="angle-right" iconType="solid" horizontal />
<Card title="subscribe('logs')" href="/reference/arbitrum-subscribelogs" icon="angle-right" iconType="solid" horizontal />
<Card title="subscribe('syncing')" href="/reference/arbitrum-subscribesyncing" icon="angle-right" iconType="solid" horizontal />
</CardGroup>

The subscriptions created can be cleared using the following method:

<CardGroup>
