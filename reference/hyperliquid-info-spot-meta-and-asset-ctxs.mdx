## Parameters

### Request body

* `type` (string, required) — The request type. Must be `"spotMetaAndAssetCtxs"` to retrieve spot market metadata and asset contexts.

## Response

The response returns an array with two elements:
1. **Token metadata array** — Detailed specifications for all spot tokens
2. **Market context array** — Real-time trading data and supply information

### Token Metadata Structure

Each token metadata object contains:

* `name` (string) — Token symbol/ticker (e.g., "PURR", "HYPE")
* `szDecimals` (number) — Size decimals for trade sizing precision
* `weiDecimals` (number) — Wei decimals for on-chain representation
* `index` (number) — Unique index identifier for the token
* `tokenId` (string) — Hexadecimal token identifier
* `isCanonical` (boolean) — Whether this is the canonical version of the token
* `evmContract` (object/null) — EVM contract details if bridged:
  * `address` (string) — Contract address on EVM chain
  * `evm_extra_wei_decimals` (number) — Additional decimal adjustment for EVM
* `fullName` (string/null) — Full descriptive name of the token
* `deployerTradingFeeShare` (string) — Fee share percentage for token deployer

### Market Context Structure

Each market context object contains:

* `prevDayPx` (string) — Previous day's closing price
* `dayNtlVlm` (string) — Daily notional volume in USDC
* `markPx` (string) — Current mark price
* `midPx` (string) — Current mid price from order book
* `circulatingSupply` (string) — Circulating token supply
* `coin` (string) — Trading pair identifier (e.g., "PURR/USDC", "@150")
* `totalSupply` (string) — Total token supply
* `dayBaseVlm` (string) — Daily base asset volume

### Trading Pair Notation

* **Named pairs** — Direct symbol notation (e.g., "PURR/USDC")
* **Index pairs** — Reference by index (e.g., "@150" for token index 150)
* **Base pair** — Most pairs trade against USDC as the quote currency
