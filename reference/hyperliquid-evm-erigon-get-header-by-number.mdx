## Parameters

1. **block number** (integer, required): The block number to retrieve the header for

## Response

The method returns a block header object with the following fields:

## Compatibility note

This method is functionally identical to `ots_getHeaderByNumber`. The `erigon_` prefix exists for compatibility with:
- Otterscan block explorer (which checks for Erigon nodes)
- Tools expecting Erigon-specific endpoints
- Migration paths from Erigon to other node implementations

## Use cases

The `erigon_getHeaderByNumber` method is essential for:

* **Otterscan compatibility**: Allow Otterscan to detect node type
* **Tool migration**: Support tools moving from Erigon nodes
* **Block header retrieval**: Efficiently fetch header data
* **Cross-client compatibility**: Work with tools supporting multiple clients
* **Legacy support**: Maintain compatibility with older integrations
* **Node detection**: Identify nodes supporting Erigon-like APIs
* **Development tools**: Support development frameworks expecting Erigon
* **Block verification**: Validate block headers across different clients
* **API standardization**: Provide familiar endpoints for developers
* **Infrastructure flexibility**: Allow switching between node types

This alias method ensures maximum compatibility with existing Ethereum tooling and block explorers.
