## What is Postman?

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a popular collaboration platform for developers that simplifies the process of building, testing, and documenting APIs. It allows developers to send HTTP requests and receive responses in a user-friendly interface, making it easy to debug and test APIs.

This collection allows you to test Bitcoin RPC methods using your Chainstack node conveniently.
