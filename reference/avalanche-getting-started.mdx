## What is the Avalanche protocol?

Avalanche is a blockchain protocol that is designed to be EVM-compatible, meaning that it supports the same programming languages and smart contract standards as Ethereum. This allows developers to easily port their existing Ethereum-based applications to the Avalanche network without having to learn new languages or rewrite their code from scratch.

Find useful Avalanche tools in the [Avalanche tooling](/docs/avalanche-tooling) section.

### Avalanche C-chain

The C-Chain, which stands for Contract Chain, is the default smart contract network on the Avalanche platform. It is a highly scalable and decentralized smart contract platform that allows developers to create and deploy custom smart contracts using EVM-compatible tools. The C-Chain operates on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which ensures fast transaction finality and high throughput.

## What is the Avalanche API

The Avalanche API allows developers to communicate with the Avalanche blockchain to build applications.

To read data from and send transactions to the Avalanche blockchain, an application must connect to an Avalanche RPC node.

When communicating with an Avalanche RPC node, the Avalanche client implements a JSON-RPC specification, a communication protocol allowing one to make remote calls and execute them as if they were made locally.

## How to start using the Avalanche API

To use the Avalanche API, you need access to an Avalanche RPC node.

Follow these steps to sign up on Chainstack, deploy an Avalanche RPC node, and find your endpoint credentials:

<Steps>
<Step>
[Sign up with Chainstack](https://console.chainstack.com/user/account/create).
</Step>
<Step>
[Deploy a node](/docs/manage-your-networks#join-a-public-network).
</Step>
<Step>
[View node access and credentials](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).
</Step>
</Steps>
Now you are ready to connect to the Avalanche blockchain and use the Avalanche API to build.
