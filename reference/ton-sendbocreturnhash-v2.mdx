title: sendBocReturnHash | TON v2
openapi: "/openapi/ton_node_api/v2/sendBocReturnHash.json POST /sendBocReturnHash"
---

The `sendBocReturnHash` method sends a serialized bag-of-cells (BoC) to the TON blockchain and returns the message hash. This method is similar to [sendBoc](/reference/ton-sendboc-v2) but additionally returns the hash of the sent message for tracking purposes.

## Request body

* `boc` (string, required) — The serialized bag-of-cells in base64 format. This contains the signed external message to be sent to the blockchain.

## JSON-RPC

## Response

* `ok` (boolean) — Whether the operation was successful.

* `result` (object) — The result of the operation. Contains:

  * `@type` (string) — The type of the result, typically `raw.extMessageInfo`.
  * `hash` (string) — The hash of the sent message. This can be used to track the transaction status.
  * `@extra` (string) — Extra information about the operation.

## Use case

The `sendBocReturnHash` method is preferred over `sendBoc` when you need to track transaction status:

1. Wallet applications can display the transaction hash to users for tracking.
2. Backend services can store the hash for transaction monitoring and confirmation.
3. Trading bots can track order execution status using the returned hash.
4. Payment systems can correlate transaction hashes with internal records.
5. DApps can provide users with explorer links using the transaction hash.

Here's an example of sending a transaction and receiving the hash:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v2/sendBocReturnHash' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "boc": "te6ccgEBAgEAqwAB4YgBVbC7Hu+g3htYXzst8L5ucV76NMzeBK3URJKebN2Y1kwADRfFu/r0HxgrOp/Iml8Li5x4gR10J5XYFS8z0fMWJ6JPeUF5xNSLrSDGFIqhJqkW1SEYQF8Dw5p4dI3oaFs4LCmpoxdkfKw0AAAAGAAcAQBoQgAwwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL68="
  }'
  ```

<Tip>
  Use the returned hash with [getTransactions](/reference/ton-gettransactions-v2) or a block explorer to confirm your transaction was processed successfully.
