title: eth_call | zkEVM
openapi: /openapi/polygon_zkevm_node_api/eth_call.json POST /942aad90bb6a082676497030b81e40ba
---

Polygon zkEVM API method that enables instant execution of a new message call without requiring the creation of a transaction on the blockchain. This can be useful for testing and debugging by simulating transfers or smart contract transactions and retrieving data from the blockchain.

**Disclaimer**

The interactive example in this page uses `eth_call` to call the `totalSupply()` method from the [WETH smart contract on Polygon zkEVM](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/token/0x4F9A0e7FD2Bf6067db6994CF12E4495Df938E6e9#readContract). You can use the [Chainstack EVM Knife](https://web3tools.chainstacklabs.com/hexadecimal-decimal) to convert the result.

## Parameters

* `object` — the transaction call object:

  + `from` — (optional) the address string used to send the transaction.
  + `to` — the string of the address to which the transaction is directed, a wallet, or a smart contract.
  + `gas` — (optional) the maximum amount of gas that can be used by the transaction.
  + `gasprice` — (optional) the amount of gas price the sender is willing to pay for each gas unit in [Wei](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ether/#denominations).
  + `value` — (optional) the value sent with this transaction, encoded as hexadecimal.
  + `data` — (optional) additional data to be sent with the call, usually used to invoke functions from smart contracts as a string of the hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. See the [Ethereum Contract ABI](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/abi-spec.html).
* `quantity or tag` — the integer of a block encoded as hexadecimal or the string with:

  + `latest` — the most recent block in the blockchain and the current state of the blockchain at the most recent block
  + `earliest` — the earliest available or genesis block
  + `pending` — the pending state and transactions block. The current state of transactions that have been broadcast to the network but have not yet been included in a block.

<Note>
See the [default block parameter](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#the-default-block-parameter).
</Note>


## Response

* `data` — the result of executing the specified call on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), encoded as a hexadecimal string.

## `eth_call` code examples

The following code snippets demonstrate how to simulate a standard ether transfer between two accounts. Note that when using `eth_call` to simulate a transfer or a smart contract transaction, the sender account must have a sufficient balance to cover the associated gas fee.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript web3.js
const { Web3 } = require('web3');
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

async function simulateTransfer() {
    try {
        // Define the accounts to transfer between
        const fromAddress = "0x3eb6347f6282E78F778C23c97E8657F5EE5378E0";
        const toAddress = "0x19e7e376e7c213b7e7e7e46cc70a5dd086daff2a";

        // Define the value to transfer (converted to Wei)
        const value = web3.utils.toWei("100", "ether");

        // Build transaction object
        const transactionObject = {
            from: fromAddress,
            to: toAddress,
            gas: 21000, // 21000 is the standard for a regular tranfer
            value: value,
            data: ""
        }

        // Use eth_call to simulate the transfer on the latest block
        const result = await web3.eth.call({
            transactionObject
        }, "latest");

        console.log(`Transaction hash: ${result}`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
    }
}

simulateTransfer();
```

```javascript ethers.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);

const simulateTransfer = async () => {
  try {    
    // Define the accounts to transfer between
    const fromAddress = "0x3eb6347f6282E78F778C23c97E8657F5EE5378E0";
    const toAddress = "0x19e7e376e7c213b7e7e7e46cc70a5dd086daff2a";

    // Define the value to transfer
    const value = ethers.parseEther("1");

    // Build transaction object
    const transactionObject = {
        from: fromAddress,
        to: toAddress,
        gasLimit: ethers.toQuantity(21000),
        value: value
    }

    // Use eth_call to simulate the transfer on the latest block
    const result = await provider.call(transactionObject);
    console.log(`Result: ${result}`);

  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);

  }
}

simulateTransfer();
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3  
node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL"

web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url)) 

# Define the accounts to transfer between
from_address = web3.to_checksum_address('0x3eb6347f6282E78F778C23c97E8657F5EE5378E0')
to_address = web3.to_checksum_address('0x19e7e376e7c213b7e7e7e46cc70a5dd086daff2a')

# Define the value to transfer (in Ether)
value = web3.to_wei(1, 'ether')

# Build the transaction object
transaction = {
    'from': from_address,
    'to': to_address,
    'gas': 21000,  # 21000 is the standard for a regular transfer
    'value': value,
    'data': '',
}

# Use eth_call to simulate the transfer
result = web3.eth.call(transaction, 'latest')
print(result)
```
</CodeGroup>


Executing this code will produce a return value of `0x`, indicating a successful transaction. This implies that the transaction will be executed without errors when the code is used to send the transaction.

## Use case

A common use case for `eth_call` is calling smart contract functions. For example, interact with an ERC-20 token smart contract deployed on the zlEVM network and retrieve the balance of a specific account.
