- **Pricing**
	- Chainstack pricing was rehauled. Check out the changes in our [pricing page](https://chainstack.com/pricing/). And learn more about [how our pricing works](/docs/pricing-introduction).
	- With pricing rehaul, we're introducing [request units](/docs/pricing-introduction#what-are-request-units). This allows us to offer a fairer and more flexible pricing structure.
- **Platform**. [Global elastic nodes](/docs/global-elastic-node) are available for Ethereum Mainnet. Enjoy geo-balanced nodes with enhanced performance and reduced latency.
