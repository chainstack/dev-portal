**Subgraphs**. Chainstack is sunsetting its Subgraphs service and transitioning all Subgraphs users to [Ormi](https://ormilabs.com/), a next-generation subgraph indexer built for real-time production workloads.

To ensure continuity, Chainstack has partnered with Ormi to support existing Subgraphs. All subgraph migrations will be handled by Ormi, and your data and schemas will remain unchanged. Your only required action is to swap the subgraph endpoint. Indexing will continue using Chainstack-powered RPC infrastructure.

All users will receive an email invitation from Ormi to join a dedicated Telegram support group. We recommend joining this group to stay informed during the transition. In rare cases where subgraph code or deployment issues require additional steps, the Ormi team will coordinate directly with you there to ensure your subgraphs continue running smoothly.

**What this means for you:**

- No new Subgraphs can be created on Chainstack after January 5, 2026
- Subgraphs will be disabled on Chainstack on February 1, 2026
- No Subgraphs usage or billing will occur on Chainstack after February 1

To support a smooth transition, Ormi will provide one month of free access from February 1 to March 1, 2026 (00:00 UTC).
