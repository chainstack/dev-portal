**Subgraphs**. Chainstack Subgraphs is migrating to our partner [Ormi](https://ormilabs.com/).

- Effective immediately: You can no longer create new subgraphs on Chainstack.
- Until February 1, 2026: Existing subgraphs will continue to run.
- After February 1, 2026: The Chainstack Subgraphs service will be disabled.

To continue using subgraphs, migrate to Ormi by following the [migration guide](https://docs.ormilabs.com/subgraphs/tutorials/migrate-chainstack-subgraphs). Migration requires only an endpoint change—no reindexing needed.
