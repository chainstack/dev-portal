### Examples of API calls

Here you will find a collection of examples in JavaScript and Python to familiarize yourself with the Chainstack platform API.

#### API key authentication

The Chainstack API relies on API keys to authenticate requests. To provide your API key, include it in the `Authorization` header. The header's value should comprise the `Bearer` prefix followed by the secret key generated through the platform's user interface.

Here's an example using curl:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl -X GET 'https://api.chainstack.com/v1/organization/' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Note that all API requests must be made over HTTPS for security reasons.
</Warning>

#### API calls using JavaScript

This example demonstrates how you can engage with the Chainstack platform API using node.js and the Axios library. It's a practical illustration of how to communicate with the API using code.

<Info>
  Note that this example employs the `dotenv` package to load sensitive data from environment variables. This is an effective strategy to ensure the security of your secret keys, for example:

  `BEARER_TOKEN=”YOUR_API_KEY"`
</Info>

Make sure to install `axios` and `dotenv` before running the code:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  npm i axios dotenv
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JavaScript
  require('dotenv').config();
  const axios = require('axios');

  async function getOrganization() {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get('https://api.chainstack.com/v1/organization/', {
        headers: {
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.BEARER_TOKEN}`
        }
      });
      console.log(response.data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  }

  getOrganization();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This particular example uses the **Get Organization name and ID** endpoint to fetch information about the organization. It's a straightforward way to incorporate API calls into your routine tasks.

#### API calls using Python

This example demonstrates how you can interact with the Chainstack platform API using Python and the requests library. It's a practical illustration of how to communicate with the API using Python code.

</Info>

Make sure to install `requests` and `python-dotenv` before running the code:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  pip install requests python-dotenv
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  import os
  from dotenv import load_dotenv
  import requests

  load_dotenv()

  def get_nodes():
      try:
          response = requests.get(
              'https://api.chainstack.com/v1/nodes/',
              headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {os.getenv("BEARER_TOKEN")}'}
          )
          response.raise_for_status()
          print(response.json())
      except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
          print(f"An error occurred: {err}")

  get_nodes()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This specific example calls the **List all Nodes** endpoint to fetch data about the nodes deployed by your organization. This makes it easy to introduce API calls into your Python workflow.

## Best practices for error handling in API requests

When interacting with APIs, it's crucial to have robust error-handling mechanisms in place. This allows you to manage any errors or exceptions that might crop up gracefully. Here are some practices to consider:

### 1: Handle HTTP status codes

Always check for and handle HTTP status codes returned by the API. These codes give you a heads-up about the type of response you're dealing with. For instance, a 200 status code means your request was successful, a 400 indicates a client error, and 500 points to a server error.

### 2: Analyze error responses

Make sure to parse and scrutinize error responses returned by the API. The Chainstack API typically dishes out informative error messages that can help you get to the bottom of the issue.

### 3: Implement retry logic

Consider setting up retry logic for certain types of errors, like network timeouts or temporary server issues. But remember, the API has rate limits. So, ensure your retry mechanism is designed to handle these limits appropriately.

## Securely manage sensitive information

In your interactions with the Chainstack API, you'll likely handle sensitive information such as private keys, certificates, or access tokens. It's crucial to handle this data with utmost care to uphold a high level of security. Here are some practices to consider:

* **Be cautious with logs and error messages**. It's easy to inadvertently expose sensitive data in logs or error messages. Always double-check what you're logging and avoid including sensitive information. This is especially important in debug logs, which can often be overlooked.
* **Encrypt and safeguard stored data**. Any sensitive data stored on disk or in databases should be encrypted and protected. This adds an extra layer of security and ensures that even if someone gains unauthorized access to the storage, they won't be able to read the data without the encryption key.
* **Use secure connections**. When interacting with the Chainstack API, always use secure connections (HTTPS). This encrypts the data in transit, preventing anyone from intercepting and reading your data as it travels over the network.
* **Regularly review access control policies**. Access control policies determine who can access your sensitive data. Regularly reviewing and updating these policies ensures that only authorized individuals have access. This is particularly important in dynamic environments where roles and responsibilities can change frequently.

By following these practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of a security breach and ensure that your sensitive data remains secure.

## Test and monitor API integrations

Before deploying your application to production, thoroughly test your integration with the Chainstack API. Test various scenarios and edge cases to validate the correctness and robustness of your implementation.
