---

## MetaMask

On [node access details](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials), click **Connect wallet** to inject your Chainstack endpoint automatically.

If you need to add the network manually, use:

* Network name: `Plasma Mainnet`
* RPC URL: your Chainstack HTTPS endpoint
* Chain ID: `9745`
* Currency symbol: `XPL`
* Block explorer URL: `https://plasmascan.to`

For the testnet, use:

* Network name: `Plasma Testnet`
* RPC URL: your Chainstack HTTPS endpoint
* Chain ID: `9746`
* Currency symbol: `XPL`
* Block explorer URL: `https://testnet.plasmascan.to`

Refer to [node access details](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials) for your endpoint URL format and credentials.

## web3.py

Build dapps using [web3.py](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py) and Plasma nodes deployed with Chainstack.

1. Install [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/).
2. Connect over HTTP.

### HTTP

Use the `HTTPProvider` to connect to your node endpoint and get the latest block number.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Key Protected
  from web3 import Web3

  web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT'))
  print(web3.eth.block_number)
  ```

  ```python Password Protected
  from web3 import Web3

  web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('https://%s:%s@%s' % ("USERNAME", "PASSWORD", "HOSTNAME")))
  print(web3.eth.block_number)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where

* YOUR\_CHAINSTACK\_ENDPOINT — your node HTTPS endpoint protected either with the key or password
* USERNAME — the username to your node if you use a password-protected endpoint
* PASSWORD — the password to your node if you use a password-protected endpoint
* HOSTNAME — the host name of your node

Plasma network IDs:

* Mainnet: `9745`
* Testnet: `9746`

See also [node access details](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).

## ethers.js

Build dapps using [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/) and Plasma nodes deployed with Chainstack.

1. Install [ethers.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers).
2. Connect over HTTP.

### HTTP

Use the `JsonRpcProvider` object to connect to your node endpoint and get the latest block number:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Key Protected
  const { ethers } = require("ethers");

  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT", {
    chainId: 9745,
    name: "plasma"
  });

  provider.getBlockNumber().then(console.log);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

For the testnet, set `chainId: 9746` instead.

where YOUR\_CHAINSTACK\_ENDPOINT is your node HTTPS endpoint protected either with the key or password. See also [node access details](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).

## Hardhat

Configure [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) to deploy contracts and interact through your Plasma nodes.

1. Install Hardhat and create a project.
2. Create a new environment in `hardhat.config.js`:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```javascript Javascript
     require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers");
     ...
     module.exports = {
       solidity: "0.8.26",
       networks: {
         plasmaMainnet: {
           url: "YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT",
           chainId: 9745,
           accounts: ["YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"]
         },
         plasmaTestnet: {
           url: "YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT_FOR_TESTNET",
           chainId: 9746,
           accounts: ["YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"]
         }
       }
     };
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   where

   * YOUR\_CHAINSTACK\_ENDPOINT — your node HTTPS or WSS endpoint protected either with the key or password. See [node access details](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).
   * YOUR\_CHAINSTACK\_ENDPOINT\_FOR\_TESTNET — your Plasma testnet node endpoint.
   * YOUR\_PRIVATE\_KEY — the private key of the account that you use to deploy the contract

3. Run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network plasmaMainnet` to deploy to mainnet or `--network plasmaTestnet` for the testnet.

Plasma chain IDs are documented in the Plasma network reference.

## Remix IDE

To make Remix IDE interact with the network through a Chainstack node:

1. Get [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and set it to interact through a Chainstack node. See [MetaMask](#metamask).
2. In Remix IDE, navigate to the **Deploy & run transactions** tab. Select **Injected Provider - MetaMask** in **Environment**.

This will engage MetaMask and make Remix IDE interact with the network through a Chainstack node.

## Foundry

1. Install [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/).
2. Use `--rpc-url` to run the operation through your Chainstack node.

### Forge

Use `forge` to develop, test, and deploy your smart contracts.

To deploy a contract:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  forge create CONTRACT_NAME --contracts CONTRACT_PATH --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT --chain-id 9745
  ```
</CodeGroup>

To deploy to the testnet, switch to `--rpc-url YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT_FOR_TESTNET --chain-id 9746`.

where

* CONTRACT\_NAME — name of the contract in the Solidity source code
* CONTRACT\_PATH — path to your smart contract
* YOUR\_PRIVATE\_KEY — the private key to your funded account that you will use to deploy the contract
* YOUR\_CHAINSTACK\_ENDPOINT — your mainnet node HTTPS endpoint protected either with the key or password
* YOUR\_CHAINSTACK\_ENDPOINT\_FOR\_TESTNET — your testnet node HTTPS endpoint

### Cast

Use `cast` to interact with the network and the deployed contracts.

To get the latest block number:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  cast block-number --rpc-url YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT --chain-id 9745
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Switch to your Plasma testnet endpoint and `--chain-id 9746` to target the testnet.
