---

**TLDR**
* pump.fun tokens start on a bonding curve and later migrate to Raydium for traditional AMM trading.
* Use the `check_boding_curve_status.py` script to see if a token’s curve is still active or completed.
* Use the `listen_to_raydium_migration.py` script to track live migration events by decoding relevant on-chain transactions.
* These tools help you adapt trading strategies when tokens move from pump.fun’s bonding curve to Raydium liquidity pools.

This guide shows you how to track the lifecycle of pump.fun tokens from their initial bonding curve state through migration to Raydium using Python scripts.

## Understanding pump.fun token migration

Tokens on pump.fun start trading against a bonding curve—a mathematical formula that determines the token's price based on supply and demand. However, once certain conditions are met, the token "graduates" and migrates its liquidity to Raydium DEX.

A token migrates to Raydium when:

1. The bonding curve reaches completion status (tracked by the `complete` flag in the curve's state)
2. The token has accumulated sufficient liquidity and trading volume
3. The migration transaction is executed by the protocol

After migration, trading moves from the bonding curve mechanism to Raydium's traditional AMM (Automated Market Maker) model. This transition is significant because:

* Trading mechanics change from bonding curve to AMM
* Liquidity becomes more flexible and can be added/removed by users
* The token becomes accessible to the broader Raydium ecosystem

## Monitoring tools

This guide covers two essential scripts for tracking this migration process:

1. `check_boding_curve_status.py` - Checks if a token is still on the bonding curve or ready for migration
2. `listen_to_raydium_migration.py` - Monitors real-time migrations to Raydium

### Checking bonding curve status

The `check_boding_curve_status.py` script lets you check if a token's bonding curve is still active or has completed and is ready for Raydium migration.

#### Usage

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  python check_boding_curve_status.py TOKEN_ADDRESS
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Replace `TOKEN_ADDRESS` with the Solana address of the token you want to check. The script derives the associated bonding curve address from the token address that you provide and then makes a [getAccountInfo | Solana](/reference/solana-getaccountinfo) call to the bonding curve.

#### Example output

For an active bonding curve:

```
Token Status:
--------------------------------------------------
Token Mint:              TokenAddressHere...
Associated Bonding Curve: BondingCurveAddressHere...
Bump Seed:               255
--------------------------------------------------

Bonding Curve Status:
--------------------------------------------------
Completion Status: Not Completed
--------------------------------------------------
```

For a completed bonding curve:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  Token Status:
  --------------------------------------------------
  Token Mint:              TokenAddressHere...
  Associated Bonding Curve: BondingCurveAddressHere...
  Bump Seed:               255
  --------------------------------------------------

  Bonding Curve Status:
  --------------------------------------------------
  Completion Status: Completed

  Note: This bonding curve has completed and liquidity has been migrated to Raydium.
  --------------------------------------------------
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Monitoring Raydium migrations

The `listen_to_raydium_migration.py` script uses WebSocket subscriptions to monitor real-time migrations of tokens from pump.fun to Raydium DEX.

The pump.fun migration account is [39azUYFWPz3VHgKCf3VChUwbpURdCHRxjWVowf5jUJjg](https://solscan.io/account/39azUYFWPz3VHgKCf3VChUwbpURdCHRxjWVowf5jUJjg).

This is the account that—on the token bonding curve completion status—adds the token to a Raydium's AMM pool with the token's liquidity. This essentially constitutes token migration from pump.fun to Raydium.

Our script uses the [blockSubscribe | Solana](/reference/blocksubscribe-solana) method over WebSocket by listening to all the transactions involving the migration account `39azUYFWPz3VHgKCf3VChUwbpURdCHRxjWVowf5jUJjg`, then decodes the transactions using the Raydium IDL `raydium_amm_idl.json` that's also in our [pump-fun-bot repository](https://github.com/chainstacklabs/pump-fun-bot) . After decoding the data, it prints what we actually need—the address of the pump.fun token that migrated and the new liquidity pool address for this token on Raydium.

#### Usage

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  python listen_to_raydium_migration.py
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Example output

When a migration occurs:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  Found initialize2 instruction!

  Signature: 5KtPn3...
  Token Address: TokenAddressHere...
  Liquidity Address: LiquidityPoolAddressHere...
  ==================================================
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Use cases

These monitoring tools are particularly useful for:

* Traders who need to adjust their strategies when trading moves to Raydium
* Arbitrage bots that operate differently on bonding curves vs AMMs
* Market makers looking to provide liquidity as soon as tokens migrate
* Sniping successful tokens on Raydium early
* Analytics tools tracking the pump.fun ecosystem

## Conclusion

Understanding and monitoring the token migration process from pump.fun to Raydium is crucial for trading strategies. These tools help you stay informed about the state and location of token liquidity, allowing you to adapt your trading approach accordingly.
