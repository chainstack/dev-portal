<Warning>
  ### Deprecated notice
  Consortium networks have been deprecated. This guide is for historical reference.
</Warning>

You can add and delete new identities in your organization [vault](https://console.chainstack.com/vault).

Chainstack currently supports identity management for the following networks:

* Hyperledger Fabric networks
* [Corda Network](https://corda.network/)
* [Corda Pre-Production Network](https://corda.network/participation/preprod)

## Manage your Hyperledger Fabric identity

A Hyperledger Fabric identity is a private key and a certificate. See Hyperledger Fabric documentation: [Identity](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/identity/identity.html).

A Hyperledger Fabric identity issuer is the entity issuing certificates. Chainstack supports cryptogen or Fabric CA as an identity issuer.

Each organization on Chainstack must have an identity and an identity issuer to deploy a Hyperledger Fabric network or add a node to an existing network.

### Add a new identity

By default, your identity is issued automatically by cryptogen.

If you would like to use Fabric CA as identity issuer, [contact Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/contact/).

## Manage your Corda identity

A Corda identity consists of the following Java KeyStore (JKS) files:

* `nodekeystore.jks` — a keystore with the node's identity key pairs and certificates; protected by **Keystore password**.
* `sslkeystore.jks` — a keystore with the node's TLS key pair and certificate; protected by **Keystore password**.
* `truststore.jks` — a keystore with the network operator's root certificate; protected by **Truststore password**.

### Add a new identity

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Complete steps 1 and 2 of the [Corda Onboarding Workflow guide](https://corda.network/joining-corda-network/onboarding-workflow).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    On Chainstack, navigate to [your vault](https://console.chainstack.com/vault). Click **Add identity**.
  </Step>
  <Step>Under **Blockchain protocol**, select **Corda**.</Step>
