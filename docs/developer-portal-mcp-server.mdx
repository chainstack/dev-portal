The **Developer Portal MCP server** is integrated with Chainstack's documentation platform powered by Mintlify. This MCP server provides AI models with comprehensive access to Chainstack's blockchain development resources, documentation, and guides.

This is a streamable HTTP MCP server, and not an SSE connection. Streamable HTTP is the latest MCP standard overtaking SSE.

## Installation

## Cursor

Just click the **Connect to Cursor** button at the top of any page to automatically install the MCP server in Cursor.

## VS Code

Just click the **Connect to VS Code** button at the top of any page to automatically install the MCP server in VS Code.

## Claude Code

To add the Chainstack MCP server to Claude Code, use the following command:

```
claude mcp add --transport http Chainstack-Developer-Portal https://docs.chainstack.com/mcp
```

The MCP server will be automatically configured and available in your Claude Code conversations.

## Windsurf

To add the Chainstack MCP server to Windsurf:

1. Open Windsurf Settings by pressing `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
2. Type "Open Windsurf Settings" and select it
3. Navigate to the **Cascade** section
4. Click **"Add Custom Server +"** or edit the configuration file directly

Add the following configuration to `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chainstack-developer-portal": {
      "serverUrl": "https://docs.chainstack.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

5. Save the configuration and click **"Refresh Servers"** in the Cascade settings
6. Verify the integration by clicking the Hammer Icon in the Cascade toolbar â€” the Chainstack documentation search tool should appear

## Kiro

<Note>
Kiro does not currently support streamable HTTP MCP servers. Support is being tracked in [this feature request](https://github.com/kirodotdev/Kiro/issues/23). Once streamable HTTP support is added, the Chainstack Developer Portal MCP server will be compatible with Kiro.
</Note>

## Manual configuration

For other AI tools that support streamable HTTP MCP, use the following URL:

```
https://docs.chainstack.com/mcp
```

This URL provides access to the complete Chainstack documentation and development resources through the Model Context Protocol.

Again, do note that this is a streamable HTTP MCP connection, and not an SSE connection. Streamable HTTP is the latest MCP standard overtaking SSE.
