<Warning>
**Chainstack Subgraphs is transitioning to Ormi**

Chainstack is sunsetting its Subgraphs service and partnering with [Ormi](https://ormilabs.com/), a next-generation subgraph indexer built for real-time production workloads, to support existing subgraphs. Your data and schemas remain unchanged—your only action is to swap the endpoint.

- No new subgraphs after January 5, 2026
- Service disabled on February 1, 2026
- Ormi provides one free month (Feb 1 – March 1, 2026)

For migration assistance, join the dedicated Telegram support group (check your email for the invitation).

See the [Ormi–Chainstack transition guide](https://docs.ormilabs.com/subgraphs/tutorials/migrate-chainstack-subgraphs) for full details.
