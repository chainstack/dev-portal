## Add a node to a network

On the [Nodes](https://console.chainstack.com/nodes) page, add a node;

The status will change from **Pending** to **Running** once deployed.

## View node access and credentials

To view the access information:
1. Click your project.
2. Click your network.
3. Click the node name.

This will give you the access and credentials to your nodes.

Examples of your HTTPS node connection endpoints:

<CodeGroup>
  ```sh Key-protected
  https://nd-123-456-789.p2pify.com/3c6e0b8a9c15224a8228b9a98ca1531d
  ```

  ```sh Password-protected
  https://user-name:pass-word-pass-word-pass-word@nd-123-456-789.p2pify.com
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Examples of your WSS node connection endpoints:

<CodeGroup>
  ```sh Key-protected
  wss://ws-nd-123-456-789.p2pify.com/3c6e0b8a9c15224a8228b9a98ca1531d
  ```

  ```sh Password-protected
  wss://user-name:pass-word-pass-word-pass-word@ws-nd-123-456-789.p2pify.com
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Examples of your gRPC node connection endpoints (available for select protocols like Sui and Solana):

<CodeGroup>
  ```sh gRPC endpoint
  sui-mainnet.core.chainstack.com:443
  ```

  ```sh x-token
  b2a7442099925280a3184aef2cedd3a1
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  gRPC endpoints use x-token authentication passed in the request metadata, rather than URL-based auth tokens. See [authentication methods](/docs/authentication-methods-for-different-scenarios) for details.

## View node requests metrics

You can view the data on requests made to your public chain project node.

To view the requests data:
1. Click your project.
2. Click your network.
3. Click the node name.
This will show you the data on the requests made to your node:

* Requests made — a chart of the total requests over HTTP and WebSocket for the selected period.
* Method calls — a breakdown of the method calls to the node over the selected period. Only available for HTTP requests.
* Response codes — a breakdown of the HTTP response status codes over the selected period. Only available for HTTP requests.

The data granularity is 1 minute.

The available timeframes are—1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 7 days.

You can also see your total organization's [statistics](/docs/see-statistics).

## Switch the period

To switch the period of the displayed requests data:
1. Navigate to the **Metrics** section.
2. On your right, select the period.

## Download the aggregate data

To download the aggregate requests data:
1. In the **Requests made** section, click the hamburger button.
2. Click the format to download the aggregate data.

## Check dedicated nodes resources allocation

You can view the resources dynamically allocated to each of your dedicated nodes.

To view the resources allocated to your nodes:
1. Click your project.
2. Click your network.
3. Click the node name.
4. Under **Resources**, hover over **Dynamic**.

## Delete a node

<Warning>
  To be able to delete a project or a network, you must first delete all nodes associated with the network.
</Warning>

To delete a node:
1. Click your project.
2. Click a network in the project.
3. Select a peer node to delete. Click **Edit** > **Delete**.
