  https://nd-123-456-789.p2pify.com/3c6e0b8a9c15224a8228b9a98ca1531d
  ```

  ```sh Password-protected
  https://user-name:pass-word-pass-word-pass-word@nd-123-456-789.p2pify.com
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Examples of your WSS node connection endpoints:

<CodeGroup>
  ```sh Key-protected
  wss://ws-nd-123-456-789.p2pify.com/3c6e0b8a9c15224a8228b9a98ca1531d

3. Click the node name.
This will show you the data on the requests made to your node:

* Requests made — a chart of the total requests over HTTP and WebSocket for the selected period.
* Method calls — a breakdown of the method calls to the node over the selected period. Only available for HTTP requests.
