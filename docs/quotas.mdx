## Quotas and notifications

Each Chainstack’s subscription plan has its own quota that represents the allocated resources and usage limits that users can spend within their chosen plan.

In addition to the allocated quota, Chainstack also offers the convenience of "pay-as-you-go" billing for any extra usage beyond the specified limits. This means that if users exceed their allocated quota, they can continue using Chainstack's services seamlessly, with any additional usage being automatically charged at the applicable rates.

Visit Chainstack’s [pricing page](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) to get familiar with a quota for each plan and extra usage costs. See [Manage your billing](/docs/manage-your-billing) on how to enable or disable the pay-as-you-go feature.

Quota spending can vary depending on the combination of services that you use. Service cost is reflected in [request units](/docs/request-units#what-are-request-units).

You will receive at least two email notifications:

* On using up 80% of your plan's quota
* On using up 100%
