<Warning>
  ### NEAR support is deprecated

  Chainstack deprecated support for NEAR nodes. This page here is for legacy and in case you may find it useful. Aurora nodes are still supported.
</Warning>

This tutorial guides you through creating a simple message contract, deploying the contract, interacting with it, and upgrading it.

In short, you will do the following:

* Create a simple message contract in Rust.
* Deploy the contract using [NEAR CLI](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli).
* Change the contract state by interacting with it using NEAR CLI.
* Upgrade the contract with new functionality and redeploy the contract while migrating the contract state.
* Retrieve the old contract state and set a new state.

In the process, you will gain first-hand knowledge of how to create metamorphic smart contracts on NEAR.

## Prerequisites

* A NEAR node endpoint.
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to create the contract.
* [NEAR CLI](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli) to work with accounts, deploy contracts, and interact with the network.

## Overview

To get from zero to an upgraded contract on the NEAR testnet, do the following:

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Get a testnet NEAR node endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set up the [NEAR CLI](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli).
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Create an account on the NEAR testnet using the [NEAR wallet](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/).
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set up the project.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Deploy an initial version of the contract.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Change the contract state by interacting with it.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Deploy an upgraded version of the contract and migrate the contract state.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Retrieve the old contract state and set the new state.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Create an account on the NEAR testnet

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Go to the [NEAR testnet wallet](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/).
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Create Account**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Provide any account name that is not taken. Example: `upgradablecontract.testnet`.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Reserve My Account ID** and secure your account as prompted.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This will initiate your account on the NEAR testnet with testnet NEAR.

You can also additionally fund your account on the testnet with the [NEAR faucet](https://near-faucet.io/).

### Set up your project

Add the WebAssembly target to your environment:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Initialize your project by running in your project directory:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  cargo init --lib
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Edit the generated `Cargo.toml` file to provide your project details and setup:

<CodeGroup>
  ```toml TOML
  [package]
  name = "simple-message"
  version = "0.1.0"
  authors = ["Your name <email@example.com>"]
  edition = "2021"

  [lib]
  crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

  [dependencies]
  serde = { version = "*", features = ["derive"] }
  serde_json = "*"
  near-sdk = "4.0.0"

  [profile.release]
  codegen-units = 1
  # Tell `rustc` to optimize for small code size.
  opt-level = "z"
  lto = true
  debug = false
  panic = "abort"
  # Opt into extra safety checks on arithmetic operations https://stackoverflow.com/a/64136471/249801
  overflow-checks = true
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Create the initial contract

This is a simple contract that lets you record a message and then retrieve the recorded message.

In the `src/lib.rs` file, provide your smart contract:

<CodeGroup>
  ```Rust Rust
  use near_sdk::borsh::{self, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};
  use near_sdk::collections::LookupMap;
  use near_sdk::{env, near_bindgen, AccountId};

  #[near_bindgen]
  #[derive(BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)]
  pub struct StatusMessage {
      records: LookupMap<AccountId, String>,
  }

  impl Default for StatusMessage {
      fn default() -> Self {
          Self {
              records: LookupMap::new(b"r".to_vec()),
          }
      }
  }

  #[near_bindgen]
  impl StatusMessage {
      pub fn set_status(&mut self, message: String) {
          let account_id = env::signer_account_id();
          self.records.insert(&account_id, &message);
      }

      pub fn get_status(&self, account_id: AccountId) -> Option<String> {
          return self.records.get(&account_id);
      }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Compile the contract

Run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Create a contract account

Log in to your account that you created earlier:

1. Run `near login`.
2. Use the generated link to authorize the account in your browser.

Once logged in NEAR CLI, run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell NEAR CLI
  near create-account simplemessage.upgradablecontract.testnet --masterAccount upgradablecontract.testnet --initialBalance 20 --node_url NEAR_ENDPOINT
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where:

* `simplemessage` — any name to give to the contract that you will deploy.
* `upgradablecontract` — the name of the account on the NEAR testnet that you created earlier.
* `--initialBalance` — providing this flag will fund the created contract with 20 testnet NEAR.
* NEAR\_ENDPOINT — your NEAR node HTTPS endpoint.

### Deploy the initial contract

At this point, you have the following:

* NEAR CLI is set up to work through a NEAR node.
* A compiled simple message contract.
* A funded contract account.

You can now deploy the contract on the NEAR testnet.

To deploy, run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
  near deploy --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/simple_message.wasm --accountId CONTRACT_NAME.ACCOUNT_NAME.testnet --node_url YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where:

* `simple_message.wasm` — the name of the contract that you compiled to.
* `simplemessage` — the name of the contract account that you created earlier.
* `upgradablecontract` — the name of the account on the NEAR testnet that you created earlier.
* NEAR\_ENDPOINT — your NEAR node HTTPS endpoint.

Example of the deployed contract: [997VvZ2EAss2NjdoGMJkZwJCMTNLZmKbXP3ZnFGkCMAh](https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/997VvZ2EAss2NjdoGMJkZwJCMTNLZmKbXP3ZnFGkCMAh).

### Interact with the contract

Set the contract status message:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
  near call simplemessage.upgradablecontract.testnet set_status '{"message": "Hello"}' --accountId upgradablecontract.testnet --node_url NEAR_ENDPOINT
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where:

* `simplemessage` — the name of the contract account that you deployed the compiled contract to.
* `upgradablecontract` — the name of the account on the NEAR testnet that you created earlier.
* NEAR\_ENDPOINT — your NEAR node HTTPS endpoint.

Retrieve the contract status message:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
  near view simplemessage.upgradablecontract.testnet get_status '{"account_id": "upgradablecontract.testnet"}' --node_url NEAR_ENDPOINT
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Change the contract source code

You are now going to upgrade the contract by changing the following:

* Change the key-value pair name `records` to `taglines` and the corresponding state changing function `set_status` to `set_tagline`.
* Add the new callable key-value pair `bios`.
* Provide a way to retrieve with the new contract code the original state on the chain set through the `records` key-value pair. This is done through the `migrate` function.

Edit the `src/lib.rs` file to provide the upgraded version of the contract:

<CodeGroup>
  ```Rust Rust
  use near_sdk::borsh::{self, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};
  use near_sdk::collections::LookupMap;
  use near_sdk::{env, near_bindgen, AccountId};

  #[derive(BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)]
  pub struct OldStatusMessage {
      records: LookupMap<AccountId, String>,
  }

  #[near_bindgen]
  #[derive(BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)]
  pub struct StatusMessage {
      taglines: LookupMap<AccountId, String>,
      bios: LookupMap<AccountId, String>,
  }

  impl Default for StatusMessage {
      fn default() -> Self {
          Self {
              taglines: LookupMap::new(b"r".to_vec()),
              bios: LookupMap::new(b"b".to_vec()),
          }
      }
  }

  #[near_bindgen]
  impl StatusMessage {
      pub fn set_tagline(&mut self, message: String) {
          let account_id = env::signer_account_id();
          self.taglines.insert(&account_id, &message);
      }

      pub fn get_tagline(&self, account_id: AccountId) -> Option<String> {
          return self.taglines.get(&account_id);
      }

      pub fn set_bio(&mut self, message: String) {
          let account_id = env::signer_account_id();
          self.bios.insert(&account_id, &message);
      }

      pub fn get_bio(&self, account_id: AccountId) -> Option<String> {
          return self.bios.get(&account_id);
      }

      #[private]
      #[init(ignore_state)]
      pub fn migrate() -> Self {
          let old_state: OldStatusMessage = env::state_read().expect("failed");
          Self {
              taglines: old_state.records,
              bios: LookupMap::new(b"b".to_vec()),
          }
      }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Compile the upgraded contract

Run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
  cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Deploy the upgraded contract

You will now deploy the upgraded contract code on the same contract account where the initial contract is running.

Since you interacted with the original contract, you have changed the chain state. Deploying an upgraded version of the contract does not purge the changed state. This means that you must have a way to retrieve the changed state through the upgraded contract interface. In our simple message contract, this is done through the `migrate` function.

You will migrate the original state at the upgraded contract deployment.

Run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
  near deploy --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/simple_message.wasm --initFunction "migrate" --initArgs "{}" --accountId simplemessage.upgradablecontract.testnet --node_url NEAR_ENDPOINT
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where:

* `simple_message.wasm` — the name of the upgraded contract that you compiled to.
* `simplemessage` — the name of the contract account where the original contract is running.
* `upgradablecontract` — the name of the account on the NEAR testnet that you used to deploy the original contract.
* NEAR\_ENDPOINT — your NEAR node HTTPS endpoint.

Example of the upgraded contract deployment: [997VvZ2EAss2NjdoGMJkZwJCMTNLZmKbXP3ZnFGkCMAh](https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/997VvZ2EAss2NjdoGMJkZwJCMTNLZmKbXP3ZnFGkCMAh).

### Interact with the upgraded contract

Retrieve the original state message:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
  near view simplemessage.upgradablecontract.testnet get_tagline '{"account_id": "upgradablecontract.testnet"}' --node_url NEAR_ENDPOINT
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where:

* simplemessage — the name of the contract account that you deployed the upgraded contract to.
* upgradablecontract — the name of the account on the NEAR testnet that you used to set the original message.
* NEAR\_ENDPOINT — your NEAR node HTTPS endpoint.

Note that since this is an upgraded contract, you are retrieving the original message through the new interface: through `get_tagline` instead of `get_status`.

You can also change the state with the new function that you added to the contract: `set_bio`.

Example:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
  near call simplemessage.upgradablecontract.testnet set_bio '{"message": "Bye"}' --accountId upgradablecontract.testnet --node_url NEAR_ENDPOINT
  ```
</CodeGroup>

And retrieve the new state:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
  near view simplemessage.upgradablecontract.testnet get_bio '{"account_id": "upgradablecontract.testnet"}' --node_url NEAR_ENDPOINT
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Conclusion

This tutorial guided you through the basics of creating a simple NEAR contract, deploying the initial contract on the NEAR network, interacting with the contract, and upgrading the contract.

This tutorial uses the testnet, however, the exact same instructions and sequence will work on the mainnet as well.
