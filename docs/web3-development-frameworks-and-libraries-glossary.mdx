## Web3 libraries

Web3 libraries are a set of tools that enable developers to connect with the blockchain through third-party providers like Chainstack. Popular libraries in this domain include web3.js, ethers.js, and web3.py.

## web3.py

web3.py is a Python library designed for seamless interaction with the Ethereum network. It is commonly utilized in decentralized applications (DApps) to facilitate transaction sending, smart contract interaction, block data retrieval, and various other functionalities. Initially inspired by the web3.js JavaScript library, web3.py has evolved to cater specifically to Python developers.

## ethers.js

ethers.js aims to be a comprehensive and compact library for seamless interaction with the Ethereum blockchain and its ecosystem. Originally designed for ethers.io, it has expanded to become a versatile library applicable to a wide range of use cases.

## web3.js

web3.js comprises a collection of libraries that enable developers to interact with local or remote Ethereum nodes using HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket protocols. These libraries provide extensive capabilities for engaging with the Ethereum network.

<Warning>
  web3.js is deprecated. Consider using ethers.js for new projects as it provides better performance, smaller bundle size, and more modern JavaScript features.

## Moralis SDK

Moralis SDK allows seamless implementation of Moralis' products in backend systems. It includes features like data querying for EVM chains and Solana, Web3-based authentication integration, and utilities for data transformation and formatting.

## OpenZeppelin

OpenZeppelin is a reputable provider of crypto cybersecurity technology and services. They offer open-source frameworks for secure smart contract development and conduct comprehensive security audits for prominent DeFi and NFT projects.

## Remix IDE

Remix IDE is a user-friendly development tool equipped with a graphical interface for smart contract development. It is favored by both beginners and experts and expedites the development process. Remix integrates well with other tools and simplifies deployment to the blockchain of choice. Its visual debugger is widely acclaimed.

## Truffle

<Warning>
  Truffle is deprecated and no longer actively maintained. Consider using [Hardhat](/docs/web3-development-frameworks-and-libraries-glossary#hardhat) or [Foundry](/docs/web3-development-frameworks-and-libraries-glossary#foundry) for new projects.
</Warning>

Truffle is a comprehensive development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline designed for blockchains utilizing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It aims to enhance the developer experience and streamline the development process.

## Wei

The smallest unit of Ether, where 1 Ether is equivalent to 10^18 Wei. This unit is often used when calculating gas costs, transaction fees, and values at the most granular level. Wei allows for precise transactions on the Ethereum network, facilitating a more accurate computation of transaction costs without the need for floating-point numbers.

## Gwei

Also known as Gigawei, it is a denomination of Ether, where 1 Gwei equals 10^9 Wei. It's the most commonly used unit when discussing gas prices on the Ethereum network. Gwei balances granularity and usability, making it easier to understand and calculate gas fees for transactions and smart contract executions.

## Ether

Ether is the unit in which the value of transactions and smart contracts are denominated and executed on the Ethereum blockchain. 1 Ether is equivalent to 10^18 Wei. As the "fuel" for the Ethereum ecosystem, Ether is essential for deploying and interacting with smart contracts and DApps on the platform.
