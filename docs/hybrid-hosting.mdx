title: "Hybrid hosting"
description: "Chainstack can be used as a solution 100% hosted in your data center or with any selected components deployed in the location of your choice."
---

Ideal for clients prioritizing full control over their nodes, keys, and infrastructure, while seeking to avoid the complexity of developing proprietary orchestration tools.

### Example

A software company utilizes Chainstack's interface (either through a graphical user interface or application programming interface) to coordinate and oversee blockchain nodes, networks, and services that operate exclusively within their custom-built infrastructure.

## Chainstack-managed hosting vs hybrid hosting

With Chainstack-managed hosting, you get the complete managed blockchain services experience: monitoring, logging, backups, deployment of fully synced nodes, and request metrics. With hybrid hosting, you get the nodes running in your own infrastructure.
