title: "Clients"
description: "Blockchains can support multiple software implementations, or clients, that connect users to a blockchain network. Clients are developed to be compatible with specific protocols and serve different purposes, for example, allowing for faster transactions or managing smart contracts in an advanced manner. Some clients can also be optimized for different consensus algorithms. You can learn which clients are available for the most popular protocols on Chainstack below."

## Ethereum clients

### Consensus layer

* Nimbus — the [Nim](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2) implementation of the Ethereum Beacon Chain client.

### Execution layer

Ethereum node can have one of the following implementations of the execution layer client:

* Geth — the [Go Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) implementation. It's bigger in size and can be interacted with by using [Geth JSON-RPC methods](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API). To get the Geth client on your node, you must deploy a dedicated node in the full or archive mode.
* Erigon — the [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) implementation. It's smaller in size and can be interacted with by using [Erigon RPC methods](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/blob/devel/cmd/rpcdaemon/README.md#rpc-implementation-status). To get the Erigon client on your node, you must deploy a trader node in the archive mode or a dedicated node in the archive mode.
* Reth — available as a [dedicated node](/docs/dedicated-node).

## Polygon clients

Polygon node can have one of the following client implementations:

* Bor — the native Polygon client. It can be interacted with by using [JSON-RPC methods](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API). To get the Bor client on your trader or dedicated node, you must deploy it in the full mode.
* Erigon — the [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) implementation. It can be interacted with by using [Erigon RPC methods](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/blob/devel/cmd/rpcdaemon/README.md#rpc-implementation-status). To get the Erigon client on your trader or dedicated node, you must deploy it in the archive mode.

## BNB Smart Chain clients

BNB Smart Chain node can have one of the following client implementations:

* Geth — the [Go Ethereum](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc) implementation. It's bigger in size and can be interacted with by using [Geth JSON-RPC methods](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API). To get the Geth client on your trader or dedicated node, you must deploy in the full mode.
* Erigon — the [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) implementation. It's smaller in size and can be interacted with by using [Erigon RPC methods](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/blob/devel/cmd/rpcdaemon/README.md#rpc-implementation-status). To get the Erigon client on your trader or dedicated node, you must deploy it in the archive mode.
