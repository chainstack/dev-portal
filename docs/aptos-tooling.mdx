## Martian wallet

You can set your [Martian wallet](https://martianwallet.xyz/) to interact through your Aptos nodes deployed with Chainstack.

1. Open your Martian wallet and click the network selector.

2. In the network selector, click **ADD CUSTOM NETWORK**.

3. In the **Enter Node Url** field, enter the endpoint. See also [node access details](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).

4. In the **Enter Faucet Url** field, enter the [Aptos testnet faucet](https://aptoslabs.com/testnet-faucet) URL.

5. Click **ADD NETWORK**.

## REST API

Interact with your Aptos node using the [Aptos Node API](https://fullnode.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/spec#/).

Use your Chainstack Aptos REST endpoint. Example to get block information by block height:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl --request GET \
    --url YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT/v1/blocks/by_height/2047048\
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where YOUR\_CHAINSTACK\_ENDPOINT is your HTTPS endpoint protected either with the key or password
