## REST API

Interact with your Aptos node using the [Aptos Node API](https://fullnode.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/spec#/).

Use your Chainstack Aptos REST endpoint. Example to get block information by block height:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl --request GET \
    --url YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT/v1/blocks/by_height/2047048\
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where YOUR\_CHAINSTACK\_ENDPOINT is your HTTPS endpoint protected either with the key or password
