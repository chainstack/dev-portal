This guide walks you through your first login to Chainstack Self-Hosted and initial configuration.

## First login

### Finding your credentials

During installation, the bootstrap credentials were generated and saved to a values file:

```bash
# List saved values files
ls ~/.config/cp-suite/values/

# View your bootstrap credentials
cat ~/.config/cp-suite/values/cp-control-panel-*.yaml | grep CP_AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD
```

You'll find:

| Setting | Default value |
|---------|---------------|
| Username | `admin` |
| Password | Auto-generated (in values file) |

### Accessing the login page

Open your browser and navigate to the Control Panel URL. The URL depends on how you exposed the service:

| Exposure method | URL |
|-----------------|-----|
| LoadBalancer | `http://<EXTERNAL-IP>` |
| NodePort | `http://<NODE-IP>:<NODE-PORT>` |
| Ingress | `http://your-configured-hostname` |
| Port forward | `http://<SERVER-IP>:8080` |

You'll see the Chainstack Self-Hosted login page:

</Frame>

### Logging in

1. Enter `admin` in the **Username** field
2. Enter the generated password from your values file in the **Password** field
3. Click **Log in**

## Initial configuration

After your first login, we recommend completing these configuration steps.

### Update admin profile

For security, update your admin credentials immediately after first login.

1. Click your username or profile icon in the top-right corner
2. Select **Settings**
3. Update the following:

| Field | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| Username | Change from default `admin` to a unique username |
| Password | Set a strong password |

<Warning>
After changing your password, the original password in the values file is no longer valid. Store your new credentials securely.
</Warning>

## Understanding the interface

The Chainstack Self-Hosted interface provides access to all node management functions.

### Main sections

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Nodes** | List, deploy, and manage blockchain nodes |
| **Docs** | Link to Chainstack Self-Hosted documentation |
| **Settings** | User profile and credentials |

### Node status indicators

When viewing nodes, you'll see status indicators:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pending** | Node resources are being allocated and configured |
| **Running** | Node is deployed and operational |
| **Error** | Node encountered an issue |

## Next steps

With your admin account configured, you're ready to:

1. [Deploy your first node](/docs/self-hosted/deploying-nodes) — Deploy a blockchain node
2. [Manage nodes](/docs/self-hosted/managing-nodes) — Learn node operations and monitoring

## Troubleshooting first login

### Cannot access login page

1. Verify the UI service is exposed correctly:

   ```bash
   kubectl get svc -n control-panel | grep ui
   ```

2. Check that the UI pod is running:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n control-panel | grep ui
   ```

3. Check pod logs for errors:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=cp-ui -n control-panel
   ```

### Invalid credentials

1. Double-check the password from your values file — copy/paste to avoid typos
2. Ensure you're using the `admin` username
3. Check that the auth service is running:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n control-panel | grep auth
   ```

### Page loads but shows errors

1. Check all pods are running:

   ```bash
   ./cpctl status
   ```

2. View logs for the deployments-api:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=cp-deployments-api -n control-panel
   ```
