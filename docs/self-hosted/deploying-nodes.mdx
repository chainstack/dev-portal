This guide explains how to deploy blockchain nodes using Chainstack Self-Hosted.

## Supported deployments

| Protocol | Network | Client | Node type |
|----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Ethereum | Mainnet | Reth + Prysm | Full node |
| Ethereum | Sepolia | Reth + Prysm | Full node |
| Ethereum | Hoodi | Reth + Prysm | Full node |

<Note>
Additional protocols and networks are on the roadmap. See the [FAQ](/docs/self-hosted/faq) for details.
</Note>

## Resource requirements

Before deploying a node, ensure your infrastructure has sufficient resources available. See [System requirements](/docs/self-hosted/requirements) for detailed specifications.

<Note>
The Control Panel itself consumes system resources. When planning your infrastructure, account for both the Control Panel overhead and the resources required by the nodes you intend to deploy.
</Note>

## Deployment wizard

<Steps>

<Step title="Access the deployment wizard">

1. Log in to the Control Panel
2. Navigate to **Nodes**
3. Click **+ Add node**

</Step>

<Step title="Select protocol and network">

1. Select a protocol
2. Select a network

</Step>

<Step title="Configure node settings">

Select the deployment configuration preset.

</Step>

<Step title="Review and deploy">

1. Review your configuration
2. Click **Create node** to start the deployment

## Deployment process

After initiating deployment, the node goes through several phases:

| Phase | Description | Duration |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Bootstrapping** | Resources are allocated, client software is configured | 2–5 minutes |
| **Running** | Node is deployed and synchronizing with the network | Continuous |

<Note>
The node shows **Running** status once deployed. Initial blockchain sync happens in the background and can take 2–5 days for Ethereum Mainnet depending on your hardware.
</Note>

### Initial sync times

Sync times depend on your hardware and network, but expect 2–5 days for Ethereum Mainnet. See [System requirements](/docs/self-hosted/requirements) for specifications and a community-maintained list of hardware recommendations.

<Note>
Snapshot-based deployment for faster initial sync is planned. See the [FAQ](/docs/self-hosted/faq#when-will-snapshot-based-deployment-be-available) for the timeline.
</Note>

## After deployment

Once your node reaches **Running** status:

1. Access the node details to view connection information
2. Start using the node for your applications
