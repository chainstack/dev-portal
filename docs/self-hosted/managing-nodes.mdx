### Overview tab

| Information | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Protocol | Blockchain protocol (e.g., Ethereum) |
| Network | Network name (e.g., Mainnet, Hoodi) |
| Date created | When the node was deployed |
| Deployment ID | Unique identifier for the deployment |
| Revision ID | Current revision of the deployment |
| Date updated | Last modification timestamp |

**Access and credentials for your node:**

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Execution client HTTP endpoint | JSON-RPC HTTP endpoint (port 8545) |
| Execution client WSS endpoint | JSON-RPC WebSocket endpoint (port 8546) |
| Consensus client HTTP endpoint | Beacon API endpoint (port 5052) |

<Note>
The endpoint URLs are internal Kubernetes service addresses. To access nodes from outside the cluster, you'll need to expose these services via LoadBalancer, NodePort, or Ingress.
