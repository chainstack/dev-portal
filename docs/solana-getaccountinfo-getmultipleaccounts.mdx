---

**TLDR**
* `getAccountInfo` is straightforward and optimal when querying a single Solana account.
* `getMultipleAccounts` retrieves multiple accounts in one request, reducing network overhead and improving scalability.
* Both methods support various encoding options (`base58`, `base64`, `base64+zstd`, `jsonParsed`) to handle different data sizes and formats.
* In bulk data scenarios like decentralized finance and game leaderboards, `getMultipleAccounts` is a clear winner for efficiency.

## Main article

In the dynamic world of Solana blockchain development, efficient data retrieval is key. **`getAccountInfo`** and **`getMultipleAccounts`** are two methods that cater to this need, each with unique strengths and use cases.

**`getAccountInfo`**, a fundamental method in the Solana ecosystem, is tailored for simplicity and precision. It's the go-to choice for obtaining information about a specific account using just the account's public key. This method shines in its straightforward approach, making it ideal for scenarios where details about individual accounts are the focus.

Contrastingly, **`getMultipleAccounts`** steps in as a method for bulk data retrieval. Designed to handle the demands of batch processing, this method efficiently retrieves data for multiple accounts in a single request while it can still handle requests about a single account. This dual capability, combined with its time-efficient processing, positions `getMultipleAccounts` as a highly efficient tool, especially when dealing with complex, data-intensive tasks.

Understanding these two methods' nuanced differences and optimal applications is crucial for Solana developers looking to optimize their performance and data-handling capabilities.

## Using `getAccountInfo`

The **`getAccountInfo`** method is a fundamental feature of the Solana blockchain, designed for retrieving detailed information about a single account. This method is particularly valuable for scenarios where focused, individual account data is required, such as in account management tools or when tracking specific account activities.

**Method Structure:**

* **Endpoint**: It targets the `getAccountInfo` endpoint in the Solana JSON RPC API.

* **Parameters**:

  * **Account Public Key**: The account's public key for which information is requested.

  * **Encoding Options**: Similar to `getMultipleAccounts`, it offers encoding options like `base58`, `base64`, `base64+zstd`, and `jsonParsed`. The choice of encoding affects how the account data is presented:

    * `base58`: Suitable for smaller account data, this encoding is slower but widely used for simplicity.
    * `base64`: Ideal for larger account data, providing base64 encoded data of any size.
    * `base64+zstd`: Efficient for large account data, compressing with Zstandard before encoding.
    * `jsonParsed`: Offers a more human-readable JSON format, especially useful when dealing with accounts associated with well-known programs.

**cURL Example**:

To retrieve account information using`curl`, the command would be structured as follows:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Bash
  curl YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": 1,
      "method": "getAccountInfo",
      "params": [
        "Hr5GK3f5WqqLsr4TJ7cgVCnDaM5gY8QrD2GTPZ7K3Kpz",
        {
          "encoding": "base58"
        }
      ]
    }
  '
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Response Structure**:

The method responds with a JSON object, which includes:

* **`jsonrpc`**: Denoting the version of the JSON RPC used.

* **`result`**: The main body of the response.

  * **`context`**: Provides contextual information like the `slot` number.

  * **`value`**: An object containing detailed information about the account, such as:

    * **`lamports`**: The number of Lamports contained in the account.
    * **`owner`**: The public key of the program to which this account is assigned, in base-58 encoding.
    * **`data`**: The account's data is provided in the encoding format specified in the request.
    * **`executable`**: Indicates if the account contains a program.
    * **`rentEpoch`**: Specifies the rent epoch for the account.
    * **`space`**: The size of the account's data in bytes.

The **`getAccountInfo`** method is a crucial tool for developers needing detailed, singular account insights on the Solana blockchain, offering a straightforward approach to accessing specific account data.

## Using `getMultipleAccounts`

The **`getMultipleAccounts`** method is a robust feature of the Solana blockchain, allowing for efficient data retrieval from multiple accounts in a single network request. This method is particularly useful for applications that simultaneously process or display various accounts' information.

**Method Structure:**

* **Endpoint**: The method targets the `getMultipleAccounts` endpoint in the Solana JSON RPC API.

* **Parameters**:

  * **Account Public Keys**: An array of public keys representing the accounts whose information you want to retrieve.

  * **Encoding Options**: The format in which account data should be returned. Choices include `base58`, `base64`, `base64+zstd`, and `jsonParsed`. Each encoding serves different purposes:

    * `base58`: A traditional encoding, but slower and limited to account data sizes of less than 129 bytes.
    * `base64`: Returns base64 encoded data for account data of any size.
    * `base64+zstd`: Compresses the account data using Zstandard compression before encoding it in base64. This is efficient for large data sizes.
    * `jsonParsed`: Tries to return account data in a more human-readable JSON format, leveraging program-specific parsers.

**cURL Example**:

Here's how you can use `curl` to call this method:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Bash
  curl --location 'CHAINSTACK_SOLANA_RPC' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": 1,
      "method": "getMultipleAccounts",
      "params": [
        [
          "Hr5GK3f5WqqLsr4TJ7cgVCnDaM5gY8QrD2GTPZ7K3Kpz",

        ],
        {
          "encoding": "base58"
        }
      ]
    }
  '
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Response Structure**:

The response from this method is a JSON object, which includes:

* **`jsonrpc`**: The JSON RPC version (usually "2.0").

* **`result`**: Contains the actual response data.

  * **`context`**: Provides context like the `slot` number.

  * **`value`**: An array of account information objects or `null` if an account doesn't exist. Each object includes:

    * **`lamports`**: The number of lamports in the account.
    * **`owner`**: The public key of the program this account is associated with, in base-58 encoding.
    * **`data`**: The account data, either as a base64 encoded string or a JSON object, depending on the requested encoding.
    * **`executable`**: A boolean indicating if the account contains a program.
    * **`rentEpoch`**: The epoch when the account will next owe rent.
    * **`space`**: The data size of the account in bytes.

With **`getMultipleAccounts`**, developers can significantly streamline their data retrieval processes, particularly in applications where multiple account datasets are frequently accessed or monitored.

## Running `getMultipleAccounts` Method in JavaScript and Python

To use the `getMultipleAccounts `in JavaScript or Python, you must first set up your environment with the necessary libraries. Below are the instructions and code snippets for both languages.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed for JavaScript and Python 3 for Python; you will also need a Solana Chainstack RPC endpoint.

<Info>
  Learn how to setup Node.js projects by reading **[Web3 node.js: From zero to a full-fledged project](/docs/web3-nodejs-from-zero-to-a-full-fledged-project)**
</Info>

   <CodeGroup>
     ```javascript Javascript
     const { Connection, PublicKey } = require('@solana/web3.js');

     async function fetchMultipleAccountsInfo() {
         // Initialize connection to the Solana endpoint
         const connection = new Connection('YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT');

         // Array of public keys for multiple accounts
         const accountPublicKeys = [
             new PublicKey('Hr5GK3f5WqqLsr4TJ7cgVCnDaM5gY8QrD2GTPZ7K3Kpz'),
             new PublicKey('EAaijviraKWCWsVZtiZ5thhXoyoB5RP3HH1ZiLeLDcuv'),
             // Add more account public keys as needed
         ];

         // Fetch information for multiple accounts
         const multipleAccountsInfo = await connection.getMultipleAccountsInfo(accountPublicKeys);

         // Process and display multiple accounts information
         console.log(multipleAccountsInfo);
     }

     fetchMultipleAccountsInfo().catch(error => {
         console.error('Error fetching multiple accounts info:', error);
     });
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   This code initializes a connection to the Solana blockchain, fetches information for multiple accounts, and logs the results. Replace `'YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT'` with your actual endpoint.

### Python Setup and Usage

1. **Install the Solana Py Library**: The Solana Py library is a Python interface for Solana's JSON RPC API. Install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install solana cachetools
   ```

2. **Python Code**:

     from solders.pubkey import Pubkey

     # Initialize connection to the Solana cluster
     solana_client = Client("YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT")

     # Array of public keys for multiple accounts
     public_keys = [
         Pubkey.from_string("Hr5GK3f5WqqLsr4TJ7cgVCnDaM5gY8QrD2GTPZ7K3Kpz"),
         Pubkey.from_string("EAaijviraKWCWsVZtiZ5thhXoyoB5RP3HH1ZiLeLDcuv"),
         # Convert additional public keys to PublicKey objects as needed
     ]

     # Fetch information for multiple accounts
     multiple_accounts_info = solana_client.get_multiple_accounts(public_keys)

     # Process and display multiple accounts' information
     print(multiple_accounts_info)
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   This Python snippet performs actions similar to the JavaScript code. Update `'YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT'` and the public keys with the correct values.
