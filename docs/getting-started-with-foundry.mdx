title: "Getting started with Foundry"
---

* Foundry is a complete toolkit that simplifies Ethereum smart contract development with modular components like Forge (build/test), Anvil (local node), Cast (CLI interactions), and Chisel (Solidity REPL).
* You can compile and deploy contracts using Solidity-based scripts, specify private keys via CLI flags, and switch between local or custom RPC endpoints.
* Cast offers flexible commands for sending transactions, reading contract data, or converting values, making it a powerful tool for rapid iteration and debugging.
* Built-in testing (Forge) supports local, forked, and coverage tests, making it straightforward to manage dependencies, run end-to-end scenarios, and ensure code reliability.

## Main article

If you're diving into smart contract development, you'll find Foundry to be an incredibly handy companion. It's more than just a tool; it's a full-fledged framework that makes smart contracts' development, testing, and deployment smoother and more efficient. Whether you're new to blockchain or an experienced developer, Foundry is designed to be a reliable and comprehensive toolkit that fits right into your workflow.

Foundry is comprised of several key components, each serving a distinct purpose in the smart contract development lifecycle:

1. **Forge**: Forge is the heart of the Foundry framework, acting as a powerful compilation and testing tool. It's instrumental in compiling smart contracts, running a suite of tests (including fuzz and property-based tests), and ensuring the contracts are robust and secure before deployment.

2. **Anvil**: Anvil is a local node tailored for development. This component is invaluable for developers who need a quick and easy way to test their contracts in a local blockchain environment. Anvil enables rapid iteration and debugging without connecting to the main networks or testnets.

3. **Cast**: Cast is a versatile tool within Foundry designed to interact with Ethereum. It facilitates a range of actions, from sending transactions and querying blockchain data to manipulating local Ethereum states. This utility makes interacting with deployed contracts easier and performs various blockchain-related tasks.

4. **Chisel**: Chisel enriches the Foundry suite as a Solidity REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), enabling developers to interactively test and experiment with Solidity code snippets. It's ideal for immediate feedback and debugging in real-time, and it's compatible both within and outside Foundry projects.

This guide covers installing Foundry, setting up, compiling, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts.

## Initializing a Project

### Creating a New Project

* In an empty directory, initialize a new Foundry project:
  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Shell
    forge init
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
* To create a new directory with the project:
  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Shell
    forge init PROJECT_NAME
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
* **Note:** The `src` directory is where the smart contracts are placed.

## Compiling Contracts

* To compile the contracts, run either:

  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Shell
    forge build
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

  or

  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Shell
    forge compile
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

* The `out` directory will generate a JSON file containing compilation data, such as ABI.

## Setting Up a Local Blockchain

* Use Anvil to start a local blockchain for testing:
  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Shell
    anvil
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
* The local blockchain will run at `127.0.0.1:8545`, and you can add it to MetaMask for ease of testing.

## Deploying Contracts

### Deploying Locally or to a Custom RPC

* To deploy smart contracts, use `forge create`. Forge defaults to the Anvil local blockchain, but other RPCs can be specified using the `--rpc-url` flag.


Get a free RPC from [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/).

* Deploying locally with Anvil running:
  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Shell
    forge create CONTRACT_NAME
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
* Deploying to a custom endpoint:
  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Shell
    forge create CONTRACT_NAME --rpc-url YOUR_ENDPOINT
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
* This will likely not work because it needs a private key to deploy.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
  Error:
  Error accessing local wallet. Did you set a private key, mnemonic or keystore?
  Run `cast send --help` or `forge create --help` and use the corresponding CLI
  flag to set your key via:
  --private-key, --mnemonic-path, --aws, --interactive, --trezor or --ledger.
  Alternatively, if you're using a local node with unlocked accounts,
  use the --unlocked flag and either set the `ETH_FROM` environment variable to the address
  of the unlocked account you want to use, or provide the --from flag with the address directly.
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Options for Specifying Private Key

* Run the create command with the `--interactive` flag for a prompt to add a private key:
  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Shell
    forge create CONTRACT_NAME --interactive
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
* Or, directly include the private key in the command:
  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Shell
    forge create CONTRACT_NAME --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

## Writing Deploy Scripts

* Scripts in Foundry are written in Solidity. We'll use a Solidity script to deploy a contract. By convention, script files end with `.s.sol`.
* **Example:** Deploying `SimpleStorage.sol`.

### Creating the Deploy Script

* Create a file named `deploySimpleStorage.s.sol` with the following content:

  <CodeGroup>
    ```sol sol
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

    import {Script} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
    import {SimpleStorage} from "../src/SimpleStorage.sol";

    contract DeploySimpleStorage is Script {
        function run() external returns (SimpleStorage) {
            vm.startBroadcast();
            SimpleStorage simpleStorage = new SimpleStorage();
            vm.stopBroadcast();
            return simpleStorage;
        }
    }
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

* Deploy the contract using the script:

  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Shell
    forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url YOUR_RPC --broadcast --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

Let's break down its key components and functionalities:

1. **Pragma Directive**:

   * `pragma solidity ^0.8.19;`: Specifies that the script is compatible with Solidity version 0.8.19 or any newer version of the 0.8 series but not version 0.9 or above.

2. **Imports**:

   * `import {Script} from "forge-std/Script.sol";`: Imports the `Script` class from the `forge-std` library, which is a part of Foundry, a development environment for Ethereum smart contracts.
   * `import {SimpleStorage} from "../src/SimpleStorage.sol";`: Imports the `SimpleStorage` contract, presumably a custom contract located in the `src` directory.

3. **Contract Declaration**:

   * `contract DeploySimpleStorage is Script`: Defines a new contract named `DeploySimpleStorage` that inherits from the `Script` class. This setup is typical for deployment scripts in Foundry.

4. **Function Definition**:

   * `function run() external returns (SimpleStorage)`: The `run` function is the main entry point for the deployment script. It's marked `external` as it's intended to be called externally, and it returns an instance of `SimpleStorage`.

5. **Deployment Process**:

   * `vm.startBroadcast();`: Initiates a transaction broadcast. The `vm` object is a special component in Foundry, providing various functionalities related to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
   * `SimpleStorage simpleStorage = new SimpleStorage();`: Instantiates the `SimpleStorage` contract.
   * `vm.stopBroadcast();`: Ends the transaction broadcast.

6. **Return Statement**:

   * `return simpleStorage;`: Returns the deployed instance of `SimpleStorage`.

This script is a typical example of a deployment script used in the Foundry environment for deploying Ethereum smart contracts. It's concise and follows the pattern of starting a broadcast, deploying the contract, and stopping it. The `SimpleStorage` contract, which is not detailed here, would contain the actual business logic or data storage mechanisms.

## Interacting with Contracts Using Cast

### Sending Transactions

* To send transactions, use `cast send`:
  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Shell
    cast send ADDRESS FUNCTION_SIG PARAMS
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
* **Example:**
  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Shell
    cast send 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3 "store(uint256)" 3333 --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

### Reading from Contracts

* Use `cast call` for reading view functions:
  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Shell
    cast call ADDRESS FUNCTION_SIGNATURE
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
* **Example:**
  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Shell
    cast call 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3 "retrieve()"
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

You can use cast for conversions, for example, hex to dec:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
  cast --to-base 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d05 dec
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Or use the [Chainstack EVM Swiss Knife](https://web3tools.chainstacklabs.com/hexadecimal-decimal).

## Managing Dependencies

### Installing Smart Contract Dependencies

* Use the following command to install dependencies from a repository:
  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Shell
    forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts --no-commit
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
* Dependencies are added to the `lib` directory.

### Remapping Dependencies

* Add remappings in the `foundry.toml` file for syntax convenience:
  <CodeGroup>
    ```toml TOML
    remappings = ['@chainlink/contracts/=lib/chainlink-brownie-contracts/contracts/']
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

chainlink/contracts/=lib/chainlink-brownie-contracts/contracts/']

## Writing and Running Tests

### Example Test Contract

* Tests in Foundry are also written in Solidity. Here's an example:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Bash
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
  pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

  import {Test, console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";

  contract FundMeTest is Test {
      uint256 number = 33;

      function setUp() external {
          number = 3333;
      }

      function testDemo() public {
          console.log("The saved number is", number);
          assertEq(number, 3333);
      }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

* Run tests with:
  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Shell
    forge test -vv
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
* The `-vv` flag outputs detailed logs for better insight.

Let's break down its components:

1. **License and Solidity Version Declaration**:

   * `// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`: This is a comment specifying the license under which this file is released, in this case, the MIT License.
   * `pragma solidity ^0.8.18;`: This line specifies the compiler version. The file is compatible with Solidity version 0.8.18 and above within the 0.8.x range.

2. **Imports**:

   * `import {Test, console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";`: This line imports two elements from the Forge standard library (`forge-std`):

     * `Test`: A base contract that provides testing functionalities.
     * `console`: A utility to log output to the console. This is particularly useful for debugging and tracking variable values during test execution.

3. **Test Contract Declaration**:

   * `contract FundMeTest is Test {`: This line declares a new contract `FundMeTest` which inherits from the `Test` contract. In the context of Forge, this means `FundMeTest` is a test suite.

4. **State Variable**:

   * `uint256 number = 33;`: A state variable `number` of type `uint256` (unsigned integer of 256 bits) is declared and initialized to 33. This variable is used to demonstrate state manipulation and assertion in the test.

5. **Setup Function**:

   * `function setUp() external { number = 3333; }`: The `setUp()` function is a special function in the Forge framework that runs before each test function. It's used for initializing or resetting the state. Here, it sets the `number` variable to 3333.

6. **Test Function**:

   * `function testDemo() public { ... }`: This is the actual test function. In Forge, any function with a name starting with `test` is considered a test case.

     * `console.log("The saved number is", number);`: This line logs the value of `number` to the console, which is useful for debugging or verifying the test state.
     * `assertEq(number, 3333);`: This is an assertion statement provided by the `Test` contract. It checks whether the value of `number` is equal to 3333. If the assertion fails (i.e., if `number` is not 3333), the test will fail.

## Testing on a Fork

* Run tests on a forked network by adding an RPC URL:
  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Shell
    forge test -vvv --fork-url $SEPOLIA_RPC
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

## Coverage Analysis

* Use `forge coverage` to analyze how much of your contracts are tested:
  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Shell
    forge coverage --fork-url $SEPOLIA_RPC
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
  It will display a nice table:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
