<Warning>
### No NEAR support

Chainstack deprecated support for NEAR nodes. This page here is for legacy and in case you may find it useful.

Note that Aurora nodes are available for deployment.
</Warning>

## NEAR CLI
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Install the [NEAR CLI](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Use the `--node_url` flag to operate through your NEAR node:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash Shell
     near COMMAND --node_url YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   where

   * COMMAND — a supported [NEAR CLI](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli) command
   * NEAR\_ENDPOINT — your node HTTPS or WSS endpoint.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## JSON-RPC API

Interact with your NEAR node using [JSON-RPC API](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/introduction).

Use [curl](https://curl.haxx.se) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com).

Example to get the latest block:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": "1", "method": "block", "params": {"finality": "final"}}' \
    NEAR_ENDPOINT
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where

NEAR\_ENDPOINT is your node HTTPS or WSS endpoint.

## near-api-js

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Install [near-api-js](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-api-js/quick-reference).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Use `JsonRpcProvider` to connect to your NEAR node.

   <CodeGroup>
     ```javascript Javascript
     const nearAPI = require("near-api-js");
     const connectionInfo = {
         url: "NEAR_ENDPOINT"
     };
     const provider = new nearAPI.providers.JsonRpcProvider(connectionInfo);
     async function main() {
         const response = await provider.block({
             finality: "final",
         });
         console.log(response)
     }
     main();
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   where NEAR\_ENDPOINT is your node HTTPS or WSS endpoint.
  </Step>
</Steps>
