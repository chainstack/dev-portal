<Warning>
**Chainstack Subgraphs is transitioning to Ormi**

Chainstack is sunsetting its Subgraphs service and partnering with [Ormi](https://ormilabs.com/), a next-generation subgraph indexer built for real-time production workloads, to support existing subgraphs. Your data and schemas remain unchanged—your only action is to swap the endpoint.

- No new subgraphs after January 5, 2026
- Service disabled on February 1, 2026
- Ormi provides one free month (Feb 1 – March 1, 2026)

For migration assistance, join the dedicated Telegram support group (check your email for the invitation).

See the [Ormi–Chainstack transition guide](https://docs.ormilabs.com/subgraphs/tutorials/migrate-chainstack-subgraphs) for full details.
</Warning>

**TLDR:**

* Chainstack Subgraphs provide an easy-to-use interface for filtering and querying blockchain data, syncing results into a PostgreSQL database accessible via a GraphQL endpoint.
* With Chainstack archive nodes, subgraphs remain synced to the latest block at lightning-fast speeds and minimal latency.
* Enterprise-grade infrastructure reliability ensures a stable, scalable, and efficient data indexing experience.

<Note>
Chainstack Subgraphs are available starting from the [paid plans](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) with the [pay-as-you-go](/docs/manage-your-billing#manage-the-pay-as-you-go-setting) setting enabled.

Subgraphs are billed at $0.10 per hour plus 20 request units per request.

## Main article

Chainstack Subgraphs removes the complexity of extracting and processing data from archive nodes and deliver an intuitive UI for Web3 developers to easily filter and query data. When you deploy a subgraph and configure the query criteria, all successful hits are indexed and the results are stored in a PostgreSQL database. A GraphQL endpoint is created that you can use to access the most recent data from your subgraph, synchronized to the latest block.

Coupled with Chainstack archive nodes, Chainstack Subgraphs is the most powerful blockchain data indexing solution available. It provides extremely fast sync times and near-zero latency to keep your subgraphs at the latest block. Enterprise-grade infrastructure reliability and support will ensure you get the best of the data indexing with Chainstack.
