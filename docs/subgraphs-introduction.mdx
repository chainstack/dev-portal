**TLDR:**

* Chainstack Subgraphs provide an easy-to-use interface for filtering and querying blockchain data, syncing results into a PostgreSQL database accessible via a GraphQL endpoint.
* With Chainstack archive nodes, subgraphs remain synced to the latest block at lightning-fast speeds and minimal latency.
* Choose from Elastic Subgraphs (preconfigured) or Dedicated Subgraphs (customizable) to match your project’s needs.
* Enterprise-grade infrastructure reliability ensures a stable, scalable, and efficient data indexing experience.

## Main article

Chainstack Subgraphs removes the complexity of extracting and processing data from archive nodes and deliver an intuitive UI for Web3 developers to easily filter and query data. When you deploy a subgraph and configure the query criteria, all successful hits are indexed and the results are stored in a PostgreSQL database. A GraphQL endpoint is created that you can use to access the most recent data from your subgraph, synchronized to the latest block.

Coupled with Chainstack archive nodes, Chainstack Subgraphs is the most powerful blockchain data indexing solution available. It provides extremely fast sync times and near-zero latency to keep your subgraphs at the latest block. Enterprise-grade infrastructure reliability and support will ensure you get the best of the data indexing with Chainstack.

## Subgraph types on Chainstack

There are two Chainstack Subgraphs types:

* **Elastic**: preconfigured, deployed, and running subgraphs for the most projects like Uniswap, Sushiswap, Curve, etc. See [Work with Elastic Subgraphs](/docs/elastic-subgraphs).
* **Dedicated**: subgraphs instances maintained by Chainstack to which you can deploy your own configured subgraphs. See [Work with Dedicated Subgraphs](/docs/dedicated-subgraphs).
