If you are an <Tooltip tip="Member - an organization that is a participant in a consortium project. An organization first creates a consortium project and may then invite other organizations to participate in that consortium project.">invited member</Tooltip> of a <Tooltip tip="Consortium project - a project to deploy consortium blockchain networks. Chainstack supports cloud and hybrid deployment of consortium blockchain networks.">consortium project</Tooltip>, you will be able to see the basic access information of other nodes in the project.

To view your node access details:

1. Click your project.
2. Click your network.
3. Click the node name.
4. On the page opened, scroll to the bottom.

## View service nodes

Consortium networks are deployed with <Tooltip tip="Peer node - a node that you deploy to interact with and be a part of a blockchain network.">peer nodes</Tooltip> and <Tooltip tip="
Service node - a node deployed with your consortium network to provide network services.">service nodes</Tooltip>.

The service nodes are read-only and provide consortium network services.

To view service nodes:

1. Click your project.
2. Click your network.
3. Click **Service nodes**.
4. Click the node name.

## Invite a member to the project

In a consortium project, you can always invite a member who will:

* Deploy nodes and networks as part of your project.
* Access the project's nodes and networks details.

To invite a member:

1. Click a project.
2. Click **Members** > **Invite member**.

This will send an email invitation to join the project.

## Invite a user to the organization

You can invite a <Tooltip tip="User - a user account invited to become a part of an organization. Users invited to the organization can have one of the following roles: admin role, editor or viewer">user</Tooltip> to your <Tooltip tip="

* Admin — the role can access and change the organization's billing settings, invite users, create and delete projects, deploy and delete nodes and networks, change user roles
* Editor — the role can create and delete projects, deploy and delete nodes and networks
* Viewer — the role can view existing projects, nodes, and networks

5. Click **Invite**.

This will send an email invitation to join the organization.

## Manage your organization integrations

You can add the following Kubernetes clusters as an integration to deploy your nodes and networks to:

* [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)
* [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/)
* [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)
* Self-managed Kubernetes cluster

While Chainstack supports Amazon EKS out of the box, to add other Kubernetes clusters, please [contact us](https://support.chainstack.com/).

The integrations feature is available on the Enterprise [subscription plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/).

For instructions on how to create an IAM user with programmatic access, node group size requirements, and how to set up your Amazon EKS cluster for Chainstack integration, see [Setting up an Amazon EKS cluster to integrate with Chainstack](https://support.chainstack.com/hc/en-us/articles/900004174426).

### Add Amazon EKS as an integration

1. On Chainstack, click [Integrations](https://console.chainstack.com/integrations).
2. Provide any name.
3. Under **Type**, select **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service**.
4. Select the region where you have a deployed Amazon EKS service.
5. Provide the access key and secret of the user you have specifically created for the Chainstack integration.
6. Provide the Kubernetes namespace you have specifically created for the Chainstack integration.
7. Provide any domain name for the deployment. This domain name will be a part of your node's endpoint URL.
8. Click **Add connection**.

Once the integration is validated, you can use it to deploy your nodes and networks.

### Delete an integration

1. On Chainstack, click [Integrations](https://console.chainstack.com/integrations).
2. Select an integration.
3. Click **Edit** > **Delete**.
This will delete Chainstack-added Pods from the cluster. This will not delete the cert-manager.
