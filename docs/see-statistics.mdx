The [Statistics](https://console.chainstack.com/statistics) page provides an organization-wide view of your request units (RUs) consumption across all your nodes.

<Info>
For per-node metrics with granular request data, method calls, and response codes, see [View node requests metrics](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-requests-metrics).
</Info>

## Access the Statistics page

On Chainstack, click **Statistics** in the left sidebar.

## Node types

The Statistics page organizes data by node type:

- **Elastic Nodes** — usage statistics for your elastic nodes
- **Dedicated Nodes** — usage statistics for your dedicated nodes

Click the corresponding tab to view statistics for each node type.

## Filter your statistics

Use the filters to narrow down the displayed data.

### Date filter

The date filter lets you select a time period for viewing statistics:

1. Click the **Date Filter** dropdown.
2. Select the period type:
   - **Previous** — past completed periods
   - **Current** — the current period
   - **Next** — future periods (for projections)
3. Enter a number and select a time unit: **days**, **weeks**, **months**, **quarters**, or **years**.
4. Toggle **Include current** to include or exclude the current period.
5. Click **Update filter** to apply.

<Note>
The Statistics page displays cumulative totals for the selected period. For example, selecting "Past 1 day" shows the total RUs consumed during that day, not a breakdown of usage within the day.
</Note>

### Protocol filter

Filter statistics by specific blockchain protocols:

1. Click the **Protocol** dropdown.
2. Use the search box or scroll to find protocols.
3. Select one or more protocols, or click **Select all**.
4. Click **Update filter** to apply.

### Protocol network filter

Filter statistics by specific networks within protocols:

1. Click the **Protocol network** dropdown.
2. Select the networks you want to view.
3. Click **Update filter** to apply.

## Statistics charts

The Statistics page displays the following data visualizations:

### Usage by protocols and networks

- **RUs by protocols** — a bar chart showing request units consumed per protocol
- **RUs by protocol networks** — a breakdown of request units by specific networks within each protocol

### Usage by billing periods

- **Number of RUs over billing periods** — shows your RU consumption across billing cycles

## Understanding request units

Request units (RUs) measure the size and complexity of request processing. Different request types consume different amounts of RUs:

- Full node requests: 1 RU
- Archive node requests: 2 RUs

For detailed RU pricing by protocol, see [Request units](/docs/request-units).
