title: "Etherlink: Tezos-powered EVM Layer 2"
---

Etherlink is an EVM-compatible, non-custodial Layer 2 blockchain powered by **Tezos Smart Rollup technology**. Unlike other Layer 2 solutions that are built on Ethereum, Etherlink leverages the security and innovation of the Tezos Layer 1 blockchain while providing full compatibility with Ethereum tools and infrastructure.

Built on Tezos' advanced rollup technology, Etherlink delivers a fast, fair, and nearly free experience for developers and users. This permissionless and censorship-resistant environment enables seamless integration with existing Ethereum tools, including wallets like MetaMask, development frameworks like Hardhat and Foundry, and indexing services.

## Key features

### Fast transactions

- **Sub-second confirmations**: Soft confirmations in less than 500ms.
- **Quick finality**: Leverages Tezos 2-block finality guarantee.
- **High throughput**: Built for scalable decentralized applications.

### Fair and decentralized

- **Decentralized governance**: Stakeholders can propose, vote, and shape the network.
- **Permissionless**: Anyone can run a node, post commitments, challenge, and secure the network.
- **Non-custodial**: No exclusive or irreversible third-party control.
- **No administrative keys**: Users retain complete control over their assets.

### Nearly free

- **Ultra-low fees**: ERC-20 transactions cost $0.001 or less.
- **Minimal gas costs**: Avoids per-transaction Layer 1 gas fees.
- **Cost-effective development**: Build without worrying about prohibitive transaction costs.

## Technical architecture

### Tezos Smart Rollups

Etherlink is powered by Tezos Smart Rollups, an **enshrined optimistic rollup technology** implemented directly on Tezos Layer 1. This means:

- The rollup validation logic is built into the underlying Tezos protocol.
- Provides shared infrastructure for fraud proofs, message inbox, and refutation games.
- Ensures robust security backed by Tezos Layer 1.
- Enables true decentralization without relying on centralized operators.

### EVM compatibility

- **Full EVM support**: Deploy any existing Ethereum smart contract.
- **Tool compatibility**: Use familiar tools like MetaMask, Hardhat, Remix, and Foundry.
- **Asset bridging**: Seamless transfers to and from other EVM-compatible chains.
- **Developer experience**: Identical to developing on Ethereum.

## Use cases

### DeFi applications
- **Low-cost trading**: Minimal fees for frequent transactions.
- **MEV protection**: Decentralized sequencing prevents manipulation.
- **Cross-chain liquidity**: Bridge assets from multiple networks.

### Gaming and NFTs
- **Micro-transactions**: Nearly free in-game purchases.
- **Fast gameplay**: Sub-second confirmations for real-time games.
- **NFT trading**: Cost-effective minting and trading.

### DApp development
- **Rapid prototyping**: Quick deployment and testing.
- **Enterprise applications**: Scalable infrastructure for business use.
- **Cross-chain integration**: Interoperability with Ethereum ecosystem.
