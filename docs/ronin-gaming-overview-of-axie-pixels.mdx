## Ronin: A scalable blockchain for Web3 gaming

Ronin is an Ethereum-based sidechain developed specifically to support the needs of blockchain games and decentralized applications. Designed to address the scalability and efficiency challenges often associated with Ethereum, Ronin offers a high-performance infrastructure that is tailor-made for the demands of the gaming industry.

One of the flagship games on the Ronin's network is the Pixels game, a unique blockchain-based title that allows players to purchase and own individual pixels on a virtual canvas. Pixels leverages Ronin's Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility and efficient transaction processing to provide a seamless and cost-effective gameplay experience.

## What the Pixels game brings to the table

The Pixels game is a testament to the capabilities of the Ronin blockchain. Employing a play-to-earn model, the game enables players to earn rewards in the form of the native PIXEL token by engaging in various in-game activities, such as exploring the virtual world, building their own environments, and participating in the thriving community.

One of the key mechanics of Pixels is its use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent the individual pixels on the game's canvas. These Pixel NFTs can be bought, sold, and traded by players, creating a vibrant secondary market and empowering users with true digital ownership.

The game's decentralized governance model, powered by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), further reinforces the principles of Web3 by allowing the community to shape the game's development and future direction.

The Pixels game has already made a significant impact on the broader blockchain gaming ecosystem. Its success has demonstrated the potential of Web3 gaming to create engaging and innovative user experiences, while also showcasing the capabilities of the Ronin blockchain.

## What Axie is and what Axie does

Axie Infinity has emerged as the leading blockchain-based game, built on the custom-designed Ronin network. Developed by Sky Mavis, Axie Infinity is a play-to-earn game where players breed, battle, and trade digital pets called Axies, earning the game's native token, Smooth Love Potion (SLP), which can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currency.

The success of Axie Infinity has been a driving force behind the adoption and growth of the Ronin blockchain. As of 2022, Axie Infinity boasts over 2 million active players, making it one of the top blockchain games by user activity and transaction volume on the Ronin network.

The growth, performance, and the longevity of Axie Infinity on the Ronin blockchain have been impressive. At the start, In Q1 2022, the Ronin network saw over $2.6 billion in total transaction volume, with more than 560,000 daily active wallets. And Axie has been running ever since.

The success of Axie Infinity on the Ronin blockchain is a testament to the potential of blockchain technology in transforming the gaming industry. By providing scalability, cost-efficiency, and true player ownership of in-game assets, Axie Infinity and the Ronin network have paved the way for a new era of blockchain-powered gaming experiences.

In terms of performance, the Ronin network has consistently delivered on its promise of scalability and efficiency. The blockchain's high transaction throughput and low gas fees have enabled the Pixels and the Axie games to handle the significant user demand without compromising the user experience.

## Ronin key features:

1. EVM compatibility: Ronin is fully EVM-compatible, allowing developers to easily build and deploy Solidity-based decentralized applications on the network.

2. High throughput: Ronin is designed to scale to handle millions of daily active users and transactions, processing over $4 billion in NFT volumes to date.
