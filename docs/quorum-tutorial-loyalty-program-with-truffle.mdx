title: "Tutorial: Loyalty Program with Truffle"
---

<Warning>
  ### Deprecation notice
  Consortium networks have been deprecated. This guide is for historical reference.
</Warning>

This tutorial will guide you through creating a simple loyalty program contract and deploying it on your [Quorum](/docs/about-quorum) network.

The loyalty program does the following:

* Joins each account that calls the contract.
* Lets each account check their loyalty program balance.

The contract and the Truffle configuration are in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chainstack/quorum-loyalty-program-tutorial).

## Prerequisites

* A [Chainstack account](https://console.chainstack.com/) to deploy a Quorum network
* [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) to create and deploy contracts

Install Truffle V5.0.9 with:

```bash
npm i -g [email protected]
```

<Info>
  ### Important Notice: Truffle Deprecation

  Please be aware that Truffle is no longer actively maintained. This tutorial is compatible with Truffle version 5.0.9, but future updates or support will not be available. For ongoing projects and new developments, it is recommended to switch to alternative frameworks such as Hardhat or Foundry, which offer continued support and updates.

  For detailed information regarding the sunsetting of Truffle, please refer to [Consensys' official announcement](https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-announces-the-sunset-of-truffle-and-ganache-and-new-hardhat?utm_source=github\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=2023_Sep_truffle-sunset-2023_announcement_).

</Steps>

## Step-by-step

### Create a consortium project

See [Create a project](/docs/manage-your-project#create-a-project).

### Deploy a Quorum network

See [Deploy a consortium network](/docs/deploy-a-consortium-network).

### Get your Quorum node access and credentials

See [View node access details](/docs/manage-your-consortium-network#view-node-access-details).

### Create and compile the contract

1. On your machine, create a directory for the contract. Initialize Truffle in the directory:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash Shell
     truffle init
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

This will generate the Truffle boilerplate structure:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
  .
  ├── contracts
  │   └── Migrations.sol
  ├── migrations
  │   └── 1_initial_migration.js
  ├── test
  └── truffle-config.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

2. Go to the `contracts` directory. Create a `loyaltyProgram.sol` file in the directory.

   <CodeGroup>
     ```js JavaScript
     pragma solidity ^0.5.8;

     contract loyaltyProgram {
         mapping (address => uint) private balances;
         address public owner;

         constructor() public payable {
             /* Set the owner to the creator of this contract */
             owner = msg.sender;
         }

         /// Join a customer with the loyalty program
         function join() public view returns (uint){
             address user = msg.sender;
             return user.balance;
         }

         /// Reads balance of the account requesting
         function balance() public view returns (uint) {
             return balances[msg.sender];
         }
     }
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   * `join` joins the address with the program
   * `balance` returns the loyalty program balance associated with the address
   * `msg.sender` is the address that calls the function

3. In the `contracts` directory create `Migrations.sol`, which is a standard contract used in the Truffle framework for managing migration scripts.

   <CodeGroup>
     ```js JavaScript
     pragma solidity >=0.4.22 <0.9.0;

     contract Migrations {
         address public owner;
         uint public last_completed_migration;

         modifier restricted() {
             if (msg.sender == owner) _;
         }

         constructor() public {
             owner = msg.sender;
         }

         function setCompleted(uint completed) public restricted {
             last_completed_migration = completed;
         }

         function upgrade(address new_address) public restricted {
             Migrations upgraded = Migrations(new_address);
             upgraded.setCompleted(last_completed_migration);
         }
     }
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

4. Create `2_deploy_contracts.js` in the `migrations` directory, This will create the `loyaltyProgram.sol` contract deployment instructions for Truffle.

   <CodeGroup>
     ```js JavaScript
     var loyaltyProgram = artifacts.require("./loyaltyProgram.sol");

     module.exports = function(deployer) {
       deployer.deploy(loyaltyProgram);
     };
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

5. Create `1_initial_migration.js` in the `migrations` directory, This will create `Migrations.sol`contract deployment instructions for Truffle.

```
const Migrations = artifacts.require("Migrations");

module.exports = function(deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(Migrations);
};
```

5. Compile the contract by running:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
  truffle compile
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This will compile the contract and put it in your `build/contracts` directory in the `.json` format.

## Deploy the contract to your local development network

1. Start the development network on your machine:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash Shell
     truffle develop
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

2. Without exiting the Truffle console, deploy the contract to the local development network:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```js JavaScript
     truffle(develop)>  migrate
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

This will deploy the contract to the development network as specified in `truffle-config.js`.

## Test the contract

1. Navigate to the `test` directory

2. Create a `loyaltyProgramTest.js` file:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```js JavaScript
     var loyaltyProgram = artifacts.require("./loyaltyProgram.sol");

     contract("loyaltyProgram", function(accounts) {
       const account = accounts[0]

       it("should join the address with the program", async () => {
         const program = await loyaltyProgram.deployed();

         await program.join({from: account});
       });
     });
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

<Info>
  [Truffle: Writing Tests in JavaScript](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/testing/writing-tests-in-javascript)
</Info>

3. Start the local development network:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash Shell
     truffle develop
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

4. Without exiting the Truffle console, run the test:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```js JavaScript
     truffle(develop)> test
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

The test run output should be `Passing`.

## Deploy the contract to your Quorum network

1. Install `HDWalletProvider`. [HDWalletProvider](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/packages/hdwallet-provider) is Truffle's separate npm package used to sign transactions.

   Run:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash Shell
     npm install @truffle/hdwallet-provider
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

2. Edit `truffle-config.js` to add:

   * `HDWalletProvider`
   * Your Quorum network running with Chainstack

   <CodeGroup>
     ```js JavaScript
     const HDWalletProvider = require("@truffle/hdwallet-provider");
     const mnemonic = "word1 word2 word3 word4 word5 word6 word7 word8 word9 word10 word11 word12 word13 word14 word15";

     module.exports = {
       networks: {
         development: {
           host: '127.0.0.1',
           port: 9545,
           network_id: '5777',
         },
         compilers: {
           solc: {
             version: '0.5.9',
           },
         },
         quorum: {
           provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, 'ENDPOINT'),
           network_id: '*',
           gasPrice: 0,
           gas: 4500000,
           type: 'quorum',
         },
       },
     };
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   where

   * `compilers` — explicit Solidity version for Truffle to compile the contract
   * `quorum` — any network name that you will pass to the `truffle migrate --network` command.
   * `HDWalletProvider` — Truffle's custom provider to sign transactions
   * `mnemonic` — your mnemonic that generates your accounts. You can also generate a mnemonic online with [Mnemonic Code Converter](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/). Make sure you generate a 15 word mnemonic.
   * ENDPOINT — your Quorum node HTTPS endpoint. The format is `https://nd-123-456-789.p2pify.com/3c6e0b8a9c15224a8228b9a98ca1531d`. See [View node access details](/docs/manage-your-consortium-network#view-node-access-details).
   * `network_id` — your Quorum network ID. See [Default network ID](/docs/default-addresses-and-network-id). You can set it to `*` for any.
   * `gasPrice` — the setting must be `0` for the Quorum network.
   * `gas` — the setting must be the default `4500000` for the Quorum network.
   * `type` — the setting must be `quorum` to instruct Truffle for the Quorum network deployment.

   Example:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```js JavaScript
     const HDWalletProvider = require("@truffle/hdwallet-provider");
     const mnemonic = "word1 word2 word3 word4 word5 word6 word7 word8 word9 word10 word11 word12 word13 word14 word15";

     module.exports = {
       networks: {
         development: {
             host: "127.0.0.1",
             port: 9545,
             network_id: "5777"
         },
         quorum: {
             provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "https://nd-123-456-789.p2pify.com/3c6e0b8a9c15224a8228b9a98ca1531d"),
             network_id: "*",
             gasPrice: 0,
             gas: 4500000,
             type: "quorum"
         }
        }
     };
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

3. Run:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash Shell
     truffle migrate --network quorum
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

This will engage `2_deploy_contracts.js` and deploy the `loyaltyProgram.sol` contract to your Quorum network as specified in `truffle-config.js`.

You can view the deployed contract and the contract address on the Chainstack platform by navigating to your Quorum project > **Explorer** > **Contracts**.

## Interact with the contract

The following contract interaction example is done with GoQuorum. For GoQuorum installation instructions, see [Quorum tooling](/docs/quorum-tooling).

## Connect to a node in your Quorum network

Run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
  ./geth attach ENDPOINT
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where ENDPOINT — your Quorum node HTTPS endpoint. The format is `https://nd-123-456-789.p2pify.com/3c6e0b8a9c15224a8228b9a98ca1531d`.

Example:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
  ./geth attach https://nd-123-456-789.p2pify.com/3c6e0b8a9c15224a8228b9a98ca1531d
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This will put you in the GoQuorum console interactive mode.

## Set the ABI variable for the contract

Truffle creates the contract's ABI when you run `truffle compile` and saves it to your project's `/build/contracts` directory in `.json` format. Navigate to the directory and get the ABI.

Run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JavaScript
  var abi = JSON.parse('CONTRACT_ABI')
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where CONTRACT\_ABI — your contract's ABI in one line

ABI for `loyaltyProgram.sol`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JavaScript
  var abi = JSON.parse('[{"constant":true,"inputs":[],"name": "owner","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"address"}],"payable": false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"payable": true,"stateMutability": "payable","type": "constructor"},{"constant":false,"inputs":[],"name": "join","outputs":[{"name":"","type": "uint256"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"},{"constant":true,"inputs": [],"name":"balance","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"uint256"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"}]')
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Set the contract address

Set the address of the deployed contract.

Run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JavaScript
  eth.contract(abi).at('CONTRACT_ADDRESS')
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where CONTRACT\_ADDRESS — the address of the deployed contract. Get the address by navigating on the Chainstack platform to your Quorum project > **Explorer** > **Contracts**.

Example:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JavaScript
  eth.contract(abi).at('0x1bF2345B6789BcC1234567aE89cedFE1Ef2E34B5')
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Set a variable to the contract at the address

Run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JavaScript
  var CONTRACT_NAME = eth.contract(abi).at('CONTRACT_ADDRESS')
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where

* CONTRACT\_NAME — any name you want to call the contract
* CONTRACT\_ADDRESS — the address of the deployed contract. Get the address by navigating on the Chainstack platform to your Quorum project > **Explorer** > **Contracts**.

Example:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JavaScript
  var loyaltyProgram = eth.contract(abi).at('0x1bF2345B6789BcC1234567aE89cedFE1Ef2E34B5')
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Set the default Quorum address to interact with the contract

Run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JavaScript
  eth.defaultAccount = "QUORUM_ADDRESS"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where QUORUM\_ADDRESS — an address created with one of the node deployments. Available on the Chainstack platform under **Access and credentials** > **Default wallet** > **Address**.

Example:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JavaScript
  eth.defaultAccount = "0x12d34fe5f67ff89f1c23456c78d9123df45cb67a"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Make sure the account is unlocked by running:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JavaScript
  web3.personal.unlockAccount(web3.personal.listAccounts[0],"", 15000)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Call the contract

As the `loyaltyProgram.sol` contract has the `join` function, call `join`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JavaScript
  loyaltyProgram.join()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This will create a transaction and give you the transaction ID.

Now check the balance:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JavaScript
  loyaltyProgram.balance()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This will display the balance:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JavaScript
  0
  ```
</CodeGroup>
