**TLDR**:

* The Chainstack Compare Dashboard provides real-time performance metrics (response times, success rates, transaction confirmation) for major RPC providers across multiple blockchains and regions.
* Built with Vercel (data collection) and Grafana Cloud (dashboards), it keeps data refreshed every minute with 14 days of history.
* The ranking system prioritizes fast, reliable providers, while special metrics (e.g., transaction landing on Solana) help fine-tune your choice of provider.
* Fork the GitHub repository for full technical details and customization of this open dashboard solution.

## Problem

Choosing the right RPC provider for your blockchain or trading project can be challenging. Performance varies by region and protocol, and it changes over time. How do you make an informed decision?

[Chainstack Compare Dashboard](https://chainstack.grafana.net/public-dashboards/65c0fcb02f994faf845d4ec095771bd0) solves this problem by providing real-time performance data for major RPC providers across different regions and blockchains. The dashboard has been built with the help of Vercel (Pro plan) and Grafana Cloud (Free plan). You can either use the dashboard hosted by Chainstack or fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chainstacklabs/chainstack-rpc-dashboard-functions) and customize it to your needs.

## Solution overview

The solution consists of the two main components: data collection services and dashboard. The data collection service sends API calls to all providers, measures response times, and pushes collected data to the dashboard every minute.

The data collection service only records response times and marks requests based on whether they were successful or not. All calculations, including averages and other aggregated values, are performed by the dashboard.

### Quick start

### What you can do

With Chainstack Compare Dashboard, you can:

1. Compare RPC provider performance across regions
2. Monitor response times and success rates
3. Monitor transaction confirmation metrics (only for Solana)

The dashboard currently supports:

* Blockchains: Ethereum, Base, Solana, TON
* Regions: US West, Germany, Singapore
* Providers: Alchemy, Chainstack, QuickNode, Helius, TonCenter

<Info>
  ### Data and paid tiers

  All metrics, except for the transaction landing metrics, are updated every minute, with 14 days of historical data available. The transaction landing metrics are updated every 15 minutes.

  For the dashboard, we used paid tiers of the mentioned providers, except for TonCenter where we used the free tier.

### Special features

#### Provider ranking

We evaluate RPC providers based on their speed (response time) and reliability (success rate) across three regions to rank them in each region and globally. Transaction landing metrics are not considered for this ranking.

1. The lower the score, the better the provider
2. Even small success rate drops (99% vs 97%) significantly impact the final score
3. Performance is measured equally across all regions

The formula used for ranking is presented below.

Score = 1 ÷ ((1/ResponseTime) × (SuccessRate<sup>3</sup>))

### Solana: transaction landing

We send standardized test transactions every 15 min across the Solana network to measure two metrics:

* **Slot Latency** The time it takes for a transaction to be confirmed on the network, measured in slots. Lower slot latency means faster transaction finality.
* **Landing Rate** The percentage of transactions that successfully confirm within our testing parameters. This metric helps identify reliable providers for your specific region.

Each test transaction:

* Uses the Solana Memo Program for consistent, lightweight operations
* Includes fixed priority fees (200,000 microlamports/CU)
* Has the 55 sec timeout

For more technical details on the transaction landing metric, please check the code [here](https://github.com/chainstacklabs/chainstack-rpc-dashboard-functions/blob/master/metrics/solana_landing_rate.py).

We added a few enhanced endpoints for providers which offer such services. Enhanced enpoints are used only for measuring the transaction confirmation speed.

| Provider name | Default endpoint | Enhanced endpoint                                                     |
| ------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alchemy       | Yes              | No                                                                    |
| Chainstack    | Yes              | Yes, [enhanced endpoint](/docs/trader-node) with bloXroute technology |
| Helius        | Yes              | Yes, staked connection                                                |
| Quicknode     | Yes              | No                                                                    |

## How it works

### Vercel: data collection services

We chose Vercel as our hosting solution due to its simplicity and time-to-production. The [data collection services](https://github.com/chainstacklabs/chainstack-rpc-dashboard-functions) are Vercel serverless functions deployed to multiple regions. Metrics for each blockchain are collected by a dedicated function which is triggered by Vercel cron jobs every minute. Once data is collected, it is pushed to a Grafana Cloud Prometheus instance.

The service has the following performance thresholds:

* Response timeout: 55 seconds
* Block delay threshold: 55 seconds

Failures include:

* Timeouts and excessive block delays
* Non-200 HTTP responses
* JSON-RPC error responses

### Grafana Cloud: dashboards

Grafana Cloud with its hosted Prometheus instance providers hassle-free services. Thanks to it, we can focus on the dashboard quality, rather than on supporting a Prometheus instance.

Grafana Cloud stores dashboard configurations as JSON files, which makes it easier to support and improve them. Data transformation required for some charts is performed with the help of Grafana Data [Transformation feature](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/query-transform-data/transform-data/) and [PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/). Historical data is available for the last 14 days.
