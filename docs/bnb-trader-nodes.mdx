title: "BNB Smart Chain Trader Nodes with Warp transactions"
description: "Warp transactions propagate through [bloXroute's high-speed transaction relay network](https://docs.bloxroute.com/bdn-architecture). This makes your transactions available for validators to pick up and include in blocks much faster than regular propagation."

Each extra transaction (not request, just the transaction) consumed is billed separately. For details, see [Pricing](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) .

## Benefits with Chainstack

Chainstack Trader nodes with Warp transactions combine reliable nodes for pre-transaction operations with bloXroute's high-speed propagation for the transaction itself. Switching to a Chainstack Trader node is as simple as changing the endpoint in your code.

All calls go through Chainstack's infrastructure, except for `eth_sendRawTransaction`, which is routed directly to bloXroute.

## Sample use case

1. A token liquidity is deployed on BNB Smart Chain.
2. You receive a signal through your BNB Smart Chain node by monitoring the PancakeSwap contracts.
3. Your bot acts on the signal, sending a transaction via the Chainstack Trader node with Warp transactions.
4. Transaction is quickly propagated, increasing chances of winning the race.

## Availability and usage

* Available from the [paid plans](https://chainstack.com/pricing).
