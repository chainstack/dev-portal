<Warning>
**Chainstack Subgraphs is transitioning to Ormi**

Chainstack is sunsetting its Subgraphs service and partnering with [Ormi](https://ormilabs.com/), a next-generation subgraph indexer built for real-time production workloads, to support existing subgraphs. Your data and schemas remain unchanged—your only action is to swap the endpoint.

- No new subgraphs after January 5, 2026
- Service disabled on February 1, 2026
- Ormi provides one free month (Feb 1 – March 1, 2026)

For migration assistance, join the dedicated Telegram support group (check your email for the invitation).

See the [Ormi–Chainstack transition guide](https://docs.ormilabs.com/subgraphs/tutorials/migrate-chainstack-subgraphs) for full details.
</Warning>

**TLDR:**

* Set up your subgraph by adding it to the Chainstack console, configuring it via Graph CLI (install, init, build), and deploying it with the provided deployment command.
* Configure `schema.graphql` and `subgraph.yaml` carefully to define the desired indexing entities and starting block.
* Track deployment status in the console (sync in progress, up to date, or failed) and use logs for troubleshooting.
* Query your subgraph using either the CLI's **Query URL** or the **GraphQL UI URL** to seamlessly fetch on-chain data.

## Set up a subgraph

To set up a subgraph, complete the following steps:

</CardGroup>

## Add a subgraph

<Note>
Subgraphs are available starting from the [paid plans](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) with the [pay-as-you-go](/docs/manage-your-billing#manage-the-pay-as-you-go-setting) setting enabled.

Subgraphs are billed at $0.10 per hour plus 20 request units per request.
</Note>

In [Subgraphs](https://console.chainstack.com/subgraphs), you can view a list of all existing subgraphs and can filter the view using the **Protocol** drop-down list. You can create a new subgraph using the **Add subgraph** button and view the details of a subgraph by clicking on the subgraph name.

Subgraphs must be associated with a project; if you don't already have a project to add the subgraph to, see [create a project](/docs/manage-your-project#create-a-project).

To add a subgraph:

1. Click **Add subgraph**. The Add subgraph page is displayed.
2. In the **Choose network** section:

   * Choose a **Blockchain protocol**.
   * Choose the **Network**. Currently, **Mainnnet** is supported.
   * Choose the **Type**.
   * Click **Next**. The Create subgraph section is displayed.
3. In the **Create subgraph** section:

   * Enter a **Name** for the subgraph.
   * Select the **Project** that you want to assign your subgraph to.
   * Click **Add subgraph**. The details page of the new subgraph is displayed.

The subgraph details page includes information such as the **Owner**, **Creation date**, **Region**, and **Protocol**. You can view the **Metrics** about the requests made in the subgraph, view the **Subgraph Query URLs**, and the **Subgraph Deployment command**, which you require to deploy the subgraph.

## Create and configure a subgraph

Before you begin: you must have Graph CLI installed globally to build and deploy subgraphs. You can install it with npm as follows:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
  npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
  ```
</CodeGroup>

To check if the Graph CLI was installed correctly, run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
  graph –v
  ```
</CodeGroup>

To create and configure a subgraph:

1. Open a new directory in your terminal and run:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash Shell
     graph init
     ```
   </CodeGroup>
2. Configure all the required parameters that are displayed in the CLI. The Graph will download your smart contract's ABI and install all the dependencies by running `npm install` automatically.
3. Set up your `schema.graphql` file to define all the entities and key-value pairs that you want to query.
4. Go to your manifest file (`subgraph.yaml`) and make sure all the deployment parameters are correctly defined. We recommend that you only start indexing data from the block number of the first transaction that you want to track as this can save a lot of indexing time.
5. To generate AssemblyScript types for the entities defined in your schema file, in your root directory, run:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash Shell
     graph codegen
     ```
   </CodeGroup>
6. When your mappings file is configured, run:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash Shell
     graph build
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

When your subgraph compiles successfully, you are now ready to deploy your subgraph.

## Deploy a subgraph

To deploy your new subgraph:

1. In **Subgraphs**, open the details page of your new subgraph and copy the **Deployment command**, which will have the following format:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash Shell
     graph deploy --node https://api.graph-eu.p2pify.com/3c6e0b8a9c15224a8228b9a98ca1531d/deploy --ipfs https://api.graph-eu.p2pify.com/3c6e0b8a9c15224a8228b9a98ca1531d/ipfs my_subgraph_v1_0
     ```
   </CodeGroup>
2. Paste and run the command in your CLI.
3. Enter a version label for your subgraph (you can use any number/letter character combination). If the subgraph is successfully deployed, you will receive a response like the following example:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash Shell
     Deployed to https://chainstack.com/subgraphs/SG-123-456-789

     Subgraph endpoints:
     Queries (HTTP):     https://ethereum-mainnet.graph-eu.p2pify.com/3c6e0b8a9c15224a8228b9a98ca1531d/my_subgraph_v1_0
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

In the subgraph details page, the status of the subgraph will change to **Deployed. Initial sync in progress** and will continuously provide feedback on the progress of the synchronization process. When it completes, the status will change to **Up to date**.

<Info>
  If the subgraph is in the **Failed** state, click **Logs** to view four levels of messages generated by the indexer and troubleshoot the issue.
</Info>

## Query a subgraph

To query a subgraph, you can choose from either of the following **Subgraph query** options in the subgraph details page:

* **Query URL** — use this URL to query in the CLI.
* **GraphQL UI URL** — use this URL to query in the GraphQL UI.

### Query URL in CLI

To query your subgraph in the CLI, copy the **Query URL** from the subgraph details page and add it to the query. For example, to query transactions:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl -g \\
  -X POST \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"query":"{myTransactions(first: 5) { id  _value _from _to}}"}' \\
       https://ethereum-mainnet.graph-eu.p2pify.com/3c6e0b8a9c15224a8228b9a98ca1531d/my_subgraph_v1_0
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### GraphQL UI URL query in browser

To query the subgraph using the GraphQL UI, copy the GraphQL UI URL from the subgraph details page and paste it in your browser. The GraphQL UI is displayed, where you can enter the details of your query.
