title: "Exploring Bitcoin Transactions with `getrawtransaction`"
---

**TLDR**
* `getrawtransaction` retrieves raw or decoded Bitcoin transaction data by `txid`, optionally with a specific block hash.
* Verbose mode (`true`) returns a detailed JSON, while omitting it yields the raw hex string.
* Transactions typically remain in the mempool for around 14 days; dropped transactions require resubmission with adequate fees.
* Bitcoin Core runs many operations single-threaded, so complex or parallel requests may slow under heavy load.

## Exploring **`getrawtransaction`**

The **`getrawtransaction`** method is a crucial tool in Bitcoin blockchain development, allowing developers to access detailed information about transactions. This method is used to retrieve data either in a raw format or as a decoded, more readable JSON object, depending on the parameters provided.

### Parameters

* `txid`: The transaction ID, a unique identifier for the transaction.
* `verbose` (optional): A boolean flag. When set to `true`, the method returns a JSON object with detailed transaction data. If set to `false` or omitted, it returns the raw transaction data in hexadecimal format.

#### Example Usage

To fetch the detailed transaction data using cURL:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Bash
  curl --location 'YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT' \
  --header 'content-type: text/plain;' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id": "1", "method": "getrawtransaction", "params": ["dd3025c6da8f546fcdb059428b74bf560efe0b360e90e46bd428de0905fdb3f2", true]}'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Replace `YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT` with the endpoint from your [Console](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).
</Info>

### Response

The response object varies based on the `verbose` parameter:

* If `verbose` is `false` or omitted, the response is a string containing the raw transaction data in hexadecimal format.

* If `verbose` is `true`, the response is a JSON object with detailed transaction information, including:

  * `txid`: The transaction ID.
  * `hash`: The transaction hash; differs from `txid` for segwit transactions.
  * `version`: The version of the transaction.
  * `size`: The size of the transaction in bytes.
  * `vsize`: The virtual size of the transaction (considering segwit discount).
  * `weight`: A metric for the transaction's size.
  * `locktime`: The locktime of the transaction.
  * `vin`: An array of input objects, each containing details like scripts and sequences.
  * `vout`: An array of output objects, detailing where the bitcoins are going, including value and scripts.
  * Additional fields like `blockhash`, `confirmations`, and `time` are included if the transaction is confirmed.

### Understanding the parameters

#### 1. **Detailed Transaction Information: `verbose` Parameter**

The **`verbose`** parameter is optional and determines the format of the response. When set to **`true`**, it returns a JSON object with detailed transaction information, including inputs, outputs, and transaction metadata. If set to **`false`** or omitted, the response is the raw hexadecimal transaction data.

##### Example without `verbose`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Bash
  curl --location 'YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT' \
  --header 'content-type: text/plain;' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id": "1", "method": "getrawtransaction", "params": ["dd3025c6da8f546fcdb059428b74bf560efe0b360e90e46bd428de0905fdb3f2"]}'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This command returns the raw transaction data in hexadecimal format. To decode it, use the `decoderawtransaction` method.

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx jsx
  curl --location 'YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT' \
  --header 'content-type: text/plain;' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id": "1", "method": "decoderawtransaction", "params": ["020000000001010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff31031f960c04affc9b652f466f756e6472792055534120506f6f6c202364726f70676f6c642f2a9e8f693dfb000000000000ffffffff023df0692a0000000016001435f6de260c9f3bdee47524c473a6016c0c055cb90000000000000000266a24aa21a9edc3d6ba5653cb4443ee0ef0f6778e5cee98e4e2eac4282120750f91f41a1e087a0120000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"]}'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. **Fetch Transaction by Block: `blockhash` Parameter**

The **`blockhash`** parameter is used to retrieve a transaction by specifying the hash of the block in which it's included. This is particularly useful for accessing transactions within a specific block.

#### Example using `blockhash`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Bash
  curl --location 'YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT' \
  --header 'content-type: text/plain;' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id": "1", "method": "getrawtransaction", "params": ["dd3025c6da8f546fcdb059428b74bf560efe0b360e90e46bd428de0905fdb3f2" , true, "000000000000000000015c7c5ce593387df1adbb494cf2a9d261bb56095d1769"]}'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This command fetches detailed information about the specified transaction within the given block.

### Real-World Applications of `getrawtransaction`

The `getrawtransaction` method is not just a theoretical tool; it finds practical applications in various real-world scenarios. For instance:

1. **Transaction Auditing**: Financial institutions and auditors use `getrawtransaction` to verify the authenticity of transactions. They can inspect details such as input and output addresses, transaction values, and fees to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.
2. **Wallet Functionality**: Cryptocurrency wallet applications leverage this method to fetch transaction details. When a user receives or sends Bitcoin, the wallet can display comprehensive transaction information, enhancing user transparency and trust in the wallet's operations.
3. **Blockchain Analytics**: Companies specializing in blockchain analytics use `getrawtransaction` to gather data for analysis. By decoding transaction details, they can identify patterns, track asset flows, and detect suspicious activities, contributing to anti-money laundering (AML) efforts.
4. **Network Fee Estimation**: Services that provide fee estimation for Bitcoin transactions often analyze past transactions using `getrawtransaction`. By understanding the fee structures of recent transactions, they can more accurately suggest optimal transaction fees for users.

### Limited Lifespan of Transactions in the Mempool

It's crucial to understand that Bitcoin's mempool, which is the collection of all unconfirmed transactions waiting to be included in a block, does not retain transactions indefinitely. Typically, transactions remain in the mempool for about 14 days, though this can vary based on node configuration and network conditions. Detailed information about this can be found on our Mempool Configuration Page at [Chainstack Mempool Configuration](/docs/mempool-configuration).

Unconfirmed transactions that linger for an extended period may be dropped from the mempool. This is particularly relevant during times of network congestion or if the transaction fee is too low. To prevent transactions from expiring, developers should ensure they are either confirmed in a timely manner or resubmitted with an appropriate fee.

### Single-Threaded Nature of Bitcoin Core

An important architectural detail of Bitcoin Core, the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, is its single-threaded nature for processing many of its critical functions. This includes the validation of transactions and blocks. Consequently, Bitcoin Core handles operations sequentially, which may lead to limitations in processing multiple requests concurrently.

This design choice impacts how quickly the node can process transactions and blocks, especially under heavy load. It's a factor to consider when building applications that interact with Bitcoin Core, as response times can vary depending on the node's current workload.

### Conclusion

The `getrawtransaction` method is an invaluable tool in Bitcoin nodes, providing developers with the ability to retrieve specific transaction information. When used with its parameters - `txid` for the transaction ID, `verbose` for detailed transaction data, and `blockhash` for specifying a transaction within a particular block â€” it offers comprehensive insights into individual Bitcoin transactions. However, developers must be mindful of the nuances of Bitcoin's network and node operation, such as the mempool's transaction retention policy and the single-threaded nature of Bitcoin Core. These factors underscore the importance of efficient transaction management and a thorough understanding of the underlying system for effective blockchain development.
