title: "Warp Transactions"
description: "Warp transactions are a [Trader Node](/docs/trader-node) feature. Warp transactions propagate through [bloXroute](https://bloxroute.com/) — the industry leader in high speed transaction propagation and landing across high value networks, including Ethereum, Solana, BNB Smart Chain."
sidebarTitle: Overview
---

With the *Warp transactions* setting on, your transactions will be distributed in either through the high-speed transaction relay network if it's an EVM network or to directly to the leader if it's Solana. This will make your transaction be available for the validators to pick up and include in the block much faster than with the regular propagation.

## Why use with Chainstack

With Chainstack Trader nodes, you get the convenience of both worlds — reliable nodes for everything up to sending the transaction & the high speed of bloXroute for the transaction itself.

In other words, if you have a a bot running, switching your setup to a Chainstack Trader node with Warp transactions is as easy as switching the endpoint in your code.

The way Chainstack Warp transactions work is all calls go through the Chainstack infrastructure, except for one — `eth_sendRawTransaction` for EVMs or `sendTransaction` for Solana — this call is always routed directly to bloXroute.

Normally, you'd face two challenging scenarios:

* Using bloXroute alone would require crafting your own transaction and using different node endpoints from providers, necessitating a custom setup.
* Relying solely on nodes would mean creating your own low-latency setup.

However, with Chainstack, everything is done for you. You can simply use one endpoint, streamlining the entire process.

## Sample scenario

The use cases are numerous, but here's a sample one:

* Liquidity is deployed on a chain
* You get a signal on the deployed liquidity through third-party monitoring systems
* On the signal, your bot acts on the liquidity (e.g. does a purchase transaction) and the transaction is immediately propagated through the Chainstack trader node with Warp transactions enabled for any validator node to pick it up
* Once your transaction is committed by a validator to a block, you win the race thanks to the Chainstack Warp transactions propagation

For best results and reduced latency, deploy a Trader node with Warp transactions in the location nearest to your bot.

## Availability

The Warp transactions feature is available starting from the [paid plans](https://chainstack.com/pricing/).

Warp transactions (not requests, just the transactions) consumed are billed separately. For details, see [Pricing](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) with the [pay-as-you-go](/docs/manage-your-billing) setting enabled.

## Usage

Under the hood, a Warp transaction is a transaction sent to your node with:

* EVM — `eth_sendRawTransaction`
* Solana — `sendTransaction`

For example, if you send your transaction with your MetaMask connected to a Chainstack node, the transaction will be sent using `eth_sendRawTransaction`.

With the *Warp transactions* setting on, only `eth_sendRawTransaction` on EVM networks or `sendTransaction` transactions are consumed as Warp transactions. Other requests to the node are consumed as regular requests.
