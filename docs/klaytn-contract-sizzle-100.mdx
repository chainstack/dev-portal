title: "Kaia (ex. Klaytn): Contract Sizzle 100"
description: "Discover top interacted contracts on Kaia (Klaytn) with Python and Chainstack. Scan blocks, identify busy contracts, use heap data structures, and implement multithreading."
---

**TLDR:**
* This tutorial shows how to scan recent blocks on Klaytn Mainnet to find the top 3 most interacted-with contracts.
* It uses web3.py, checks if addresses are contracts by retrieving bytecode, and caches results for efficiency.
* A heap is used to store and retrieve the top 3 busiest contracts, and the script supports multithreading.
* Can be adapted for analytics, alerts, or bot flows leveraging real-time contract interaction data.

## Main article

Klaytn is an EVM-compatible protocol with a few modifications. Check the Klaytn docs for a full break-down on the compatibility: [Ethereum Compatibility](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/docs/learn/transactions/ethereum/).

In this tutorial, we'll build a quick Python project called Contract Sizzle 100. Contract Sizzle 100 prints the top 3 hottest contracts on the Klaytn Mainnet (aka Cypress Network) over the past 100 blocks.

The way it works is very simple: the script ingests each new incoming block from the Klaytn Mainnet, extracts all contract interactions, counts them and prints the top3 contracts that had the most interactions.

## Prerequisites

* [Chainstack account](https://console.chainstack.com/) to deploy a Klaytn Mainnet node
* [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/)

## Step-by-step

### Get a Klaytn node

Log in to your [Chainstack account](https://console.chainstack.com/) and deploy a node.

### Create the script

A few details on the implementation.

How do you actually identify the contract addresses? One easy way is to:

1. Retrieve off the network each block with all transactions in the block.
2. Extract the `to:` address.
3. Check if the extracted address is a contract by doing an `eth_getCode` to the address.

This process in Python, however, can be slow, so let's optimize it a bit:

* After doing an `eth_getCode` to an extracted address, cache the results so that if we get this address again, we don't do a `eth_getCode` to it as we already know this is a contract address.
* Multithread the script by using our tutorial [Mastering multithreading in Python for Web3 requests: A comprehensive guide](/docs/mastering-multithreading-in-python-for-web3-requests-a-comprehensive-guide).

Here's the final script:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from web3 import Web3
  from collections import defaultdict
  import heapq
  from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

  # Connect to a Klaytn node
  w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('CHAINSTACK_NODE'))

  # Data structure to hold the count of interactions per contract
  contract_interactions = defaultdict(int)

  # Priority queue to maintain top 3 contracts
  top_contracts = []

  # Cache for storing contract check results
  is_contract_cache = {}

  def is_contract(address):
      if address not in is_contract_cache:
          code = w3.eth.get_code(address)
          is_contract = code != '0x'
          is_contract_cache[address] = is_contract
      return is_contract_cache[address]

  def process_block(block_number):
      print(f"Processing block {block_number}")
      block = w3.eth.get_block(block_number, full_transactions=True)
      for tx in block.transactions:
          if tx.to and is_contract(tx.to):
              contract_interactions[tx.to] += 1

  # Main loop to process 100 blocks
  def main():
      latest_block = w3.eth.block_number
      print("Starting to process blocks...")
      with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
          executor.map(process_block, range(latest_block - 100, latest_block))

      # Identify top 3 contracts
      for contract, interactions in contract_interactions.items():
          heapq.heappush(top_contracts, (interactions, contract))
          if len(top_contracts) > 3:
              heapq.heappop(top_contracts)

      # Print top 3 contracts
      print("Top contracts:", top_contracts)
      while top_contracts:
          interactions, contract = heapq.heappop(top_contracts)
          print(f'Contract {contract} had {interactions} interactions')

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      try:
          main()
      except Exception as e:
          print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where

* CHAINSTACK\_NODE — your Klaytn node deployed with Chainstack
* `max_workers=10` — set to however parallel threads you feel is reasonable. Make sure don't hit the limits: [Limits](/docs/limits).

## Conclusion

This tutorial guided you through creating a basic setup to live-track the hottest contract on the Klaytn Network. There are many fun ways you can use it as basis to build upon — from passing the data to a Twitter bot account to setting up your own alerts or bot flow.
