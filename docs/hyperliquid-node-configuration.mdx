<Note>
System transactions are only available on [Dedicated Nodes](/docs/dedicated-node) with custom configuration.

## System addresses and transactions

System addresses in Hyperliquid facilitate token bridging between HyperCore and HyperEVM. They follow a specific format:
- First byte: `0x20`
- Remaining bytes: zeros with token index in big-endian format
- HYPE token: `0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222`

Example for token index 200:
```
0x20000000000000000000000000000000000000c8
```

On HyperEVM, these system transactions are recorded as pseudo-transactions to simplify the implementation of tools that need to track these, like block explorers.

See Hyperliquid docs: [HyperCore â†” HyperEVM transfers](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/hyperevm/hypercore-less-than-greater-than-hyperevm-transfers) and [nanoreth README](https://github.com/hl-archive-node/nanoreth).

## Node configuration

### Default nodes (hl-node compliant)

Chainstack Hyperliquid nodes run with the nanoreth `--hl-node-compliant` flag by default:
- System transactions are **excluded** from output
- Provides cleaner transaction data similar to the default (non-nanoreth) Hyperliquid node operation.

### Dedicated nodes (system transaction support)

For applications requiring cross-layer transfer tracking, request a dedicated node without the `--hl-node-compliant` flag.

## Requesting system transaction support

Request a Hyperliquid [Dedicated Node](/docs/dedicated-node) deployment or connect to a [reliable Hyperliquid RPC endpoint](https://chainstack.com/build-better-with-hyperliquid/) for standard operations.
