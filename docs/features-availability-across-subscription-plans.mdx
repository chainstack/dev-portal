## Debug and trace APIs

[Debug and trace APIs](/docs/debug-and-trace-apis) are available starting from the [paid plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/). For per protocol availability, see [Available clouds, regions, and locations](/docs/nodes-clouds-regions-and-locations).

## Mempool

See [Mempool configurations](/docs/mempool-configuration).

## Subgraphs

### Elastic subgraphs

Pre-configured and ready-to-use subgraphs for popular projects like Uniswap, Pancake, Curve, and so on. Instant access; no deployment or configuration necessary.

Charged in request units: 20 request units per 1 request.

### Dedicated subgraphs

Configure your own subgraphs and deploy it to the The Graph instance maintained by Chainstack.

Charged in request units and compute hours: 20 request units per 1 request + $0.10 per hour.

For the availability by subscription plans, see the [pricing page](https://chainstack.com/pricing/).

### Dedicated subgraph indexer

Your own dedicated The Graph instance maintained by Chainstack.

A dedicated indexer is available on the [Enterprise plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/). A dedicated indexer can deploy multiple subgraphs across different chains.

## Private networking

Private networking is available on the [Enterprise plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/).

Private networking is an exclusive functionality available to nodes hosted on AWS. It leverages the advanced technology of [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) to achieve a significant reduction in latency.

To set up private networking for your node, your DApp must be located in the same region as your AWS node, e.g. us-east-1. When using private networking, node interaction will be performed through AWS internal infrastructure and will not be exposed to the public internet. This approach enhances security measures and minimizes processing time, delivering optimal performance.

## Node customization

Node customization is available on the [Enterprise plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) for [dedicated nodes](/docs/dedicated-node). Below you can find the current customizations that can be used for your node. Feel free to check with us for any additional customization that's not on the list, *as these are just examples*.

### Transaction settings

* **txpool.pricebump** — the minimum increase in transaction fee required to replace a pending transaction with the same nonce. The default value is `10%`. Applicable for EVM-based protocols.
* **rpc.txfeecap** — a limit on the transaction fee. The default value is `100 base currency`. Applicable for EVM-based protocols.
  <Info>
  ### Base currency

  Base currency is the native token of a protocol.
  </Info>
* **rpc.gascap** — a limit on the gas that can be used to run `eth_call` and `eth_estimateGas`. The default value is `0.5 base currency`. Applicable for EVM-based protocols.
* **txlookuplimit** — the maximum number of blocks whose transaction indices are reserved. By default, for Ethereum and Polygon, the number is `2350000`.

### Node and network customizations

* **Dedicated gateway** — provides a [dedicated connection to the node](/docs/trader-node#dedicated-gateways), eliminating some limitations, such as the need to reconnect.
* **Custom EVM tracers** — We can enable [custom JavaScript tracers](/api-reference/ethereum_node_api/debug_and_trace/custom_js_tracer) for your dedicated EVM node.
* **Scaling node resources** — options to scale up node resources like storage, CPU, and RAM.
* **Tailored load balancing** — a dedicated gateway that balances the request load between multiple dedicated nodes.
* **Private networking** — connect your application running on AWS to a Chainstack node running on AWS through a private network. This eliminates the need for your application and the node to communicate over the internet, reducing latency and increasing speed.
* **Indexing** for Bitcoin nodes.

For any customizations not listed here, contact [Chainstack support](https://support.chainstack.com/). We are always happy to explore your case and help you.
