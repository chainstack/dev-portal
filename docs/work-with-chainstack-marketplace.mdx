## Basic workflow

To start using Chainstack Marketplace, do the following:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Go to the [Marketplace in your console](https://console.chainstack.com/marketplace/).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Purchase and install the app you decided to use.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    [Generate a Chainstack API key](/api-reference/platform-api-getting-started#create-api-key) that you will use to retrieve your JSON web token (JWT).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    [Retrieve your JWT](https://api.chainstack.com/reference/#operation/retrieveToken) using Chainstack Platform API.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Interact with your purchased app directly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Install an app

To install the app in the Chainstack Marketplace, do the following:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Go to the [Marketplace in your console](https://console.chainstack.com/marketplace/).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Install** on the app you want to install.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select the app subscription plan and click **Complete order and begin installation**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The payment will be made and the app will get installed to your console. If a payment is unsuccessful, [check your balance](/docs/manage-your-billing) and try again.

## Get access to an app

To get access to the installed app, you will use a JSON web token issued through Chainstack platform API. To interact with the platform API, you must use an API key. If you don't have an API key, you can create one either in **Settings** > **API keys** or right on the application page **Dashboard**.

With your API key, retrieve a JSON web token by using the [corresponding method](https://api.chainstack.com/reference/#operation/retrieveToken). Now you can interact with the app API by using vendor's methods.

<Warning>
  ### JWT expiration

  Note that an issued token is valid 1 hour only. Make sure to renew it in time.
</Warning>

## Delete an app

By deleting an app, you automatically cancel your subscription to it. To delete an app and cancel your subscription to it, do the following:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open the app page.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Go to **Settings**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Delete app**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Enter the requested phrase into the text field and click **Yes, I'm sure**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The app gets uninstalled and your subscription to it gets canceled. Unused period will be calculated and returned to your Chainstack balance automatically.
