**TLDR:**
* Demonstrates how to query real-time and historical liquidity, swaps, volumes, and token price data in Uniswap V2 using a Chainstack elastic subgraph.
* Offers practical GraphQL queries for common DeFi use cases – e.g., filtering by token pair, setting USD thresholds, fetching daily/hourly volumes, and monitoring top liquidity providers.
* Provides a Python-based approach to automate subgraph queries, store results, and integrate them into data pipelines or trading dashboards.

## Main article

In this tutorial, we will explore how to query Uniswap V2, an already-deployed subgraph on Chainstack. Subgraphs are a powerful solution for indexing blockchain data. You can access major DeFi protocols such as Uniswap, Curve, and PancakeSwap through elastic subgraphs. No heavy deployment or programming needed.

## Introduction

Chainstack subgraphs simplify the extraction and processing of data from archive nodes, allowing for easy filtering and querying using GraphQL. Without subgraphs, Web3 developers and users would need to aggregate, process, and filter blockchain data themselves, which involves parsing vast amounts of raw transaction data.

We will discuss a subgraph for Uniswap V2. For more information on setting up dedicated custom subgraphs, please refer to our detailed tutorial [here](/docs/deploy-a-subgraph).

## Uniswap V2 subgraph

The Uniswap V2 subgraph is an already-deployed subgraph that monitors and indexes data from Uniswap V2 smart contracts. You can explore the subgraph schema using the Explorer tool on the GraphiQL page of the subgraph, accessible via the GraphQL UI URL. Additionally, the GraphiQL page offers a convenient tool for testing different queries directly in the browser.

<Tip>
  ### Automated liquidity protocol
  Uniswap V2 is [an automated liquidity protocol](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/concepts/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works) powered by a constant product formula and implemented in a system of non-upgradeable smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

  Each Uniswap smart contract, or pair, manages a liquidity pool made up of reserves of two ERC-20 tokens.

  Anyone can become a liquidity provider (LP) for a pool by depositing an equivalent value of each underlying token in return for pool tokens. These tokens track pro-rata LP shares of the total reserves, and can be redeemed for the underlying assets at any time.
</Tip>

According to the schema, we can interact with the following entities, among others:

* Liquidity positions;
* Pairs;
* Swaps;
* Tokens;
* Transactions.

Additionally, there are several historical data entities that might be useful:

* Liquidity positions snapshots;
* Hourly and daily pair data;
* Daily token data.

Each entity contains different sets of parameters, fields and nested entities.

## Querying subgraph

There are multiple ways to query the subgraph. You can use GraphiQL, as mentioned earlier, or the command-line tool `curl`, along with many other HTTP packages or GraphQL clients implemented in various programming languages. For the examples below, we will use the `requests` package, a popular and user-friendly HTTP client library for Python.

We will write a Python function to query the subgraph. GraphQL queries are stored as separate files. You can find all the scripts and queries in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chainstacklabs/uniswap-v2-subgraph-queries).

<Info>
  ### Lowercased addresses

  Note that addresses used in the subgraph are lowercased. Using checksummed addresses or addresses with uppercase letters may result in empty or incorrect outputs.
</Info>

### Prerequisites

1. Log in to your [Chainstack account](https://console.chainstack.com/) and add an elastic Uniswap V2 subgraph in the Ethereum Mainnet.

2. Open your terminal (Command Prompt for Windows or Terminal for macOS/Linux) and run the following command to clone the GitHub repository to your current directory.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chainstacklabs/uniswap-v2-subgraph-queries .
   ```

3. Set up your Python virtual environment.

   **macOS/Linux:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   **Windows:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. With the virtual environment activated, run the following command to install the required dependencies.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Create the environment variable file (`.env`) and paste your Chainstack endpoint URL there.

   ```bash
   SUBGRAPH_URL=<uniswap_v2_subgraph_url>
   ```

### Python main.py

Let’s first create a main function that will run all the queries in a loop. We'll start by loading the configuration file (`.env`).

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  import os
  import json
  import time
  import requests

  from dotenv import load_dotenv

  # Load environment variables
  load_dotenv()

  # Constants
  GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT = os.getenv("SUBGRAPH_URL")
  QUERIES_DIR = 'Queries'
  OUTPUTS_DIR = 'Outputs'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

In our project, we store queries as separate `.graphql` files in the `Queries` folder. We will read each query file, execute it, and store its result in the `Outputs` folder.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  def main():
      # Ensure the output directory exists
      if not os.path.exists(OUTPUTS_DIR):
          os.makedirs(OUTPUTS_DIR)

      # List all GraphQL query files
      query_files = [f for f in os.listdir(QUERIES_DIR) if f.endswith('.graphql')]
      query_files.sort() # ascending order

      # Process each query file
      for query_file in query_files:
          query_path = os.path.join(QUERIES_DIR, query_file)
          output_path = os.path.join(OUTPUTS_DIR, query_file.replace('.graphql', '.json'))

          try:
              # Read query from a file
              with open(query_path, 'r') as file:
                  query = file.read()

              # Execute query
              start_time = time.time()
              query_result = requests.post(GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT, json={'query': query}, timeout=40)
              elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time

              # Save query result
              with open(output_path, 'w') as file:
                  json.dump(query_result.json(), file, indent=4)

              print(f"\nSaved results of {query_file} to {output_path}")
              print(f'Elapsed time: {elapsed_time:.2f} seconds')

          except Exception as e:
              print(f"\nFailed to execute {query_file}: {e}")

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Meta queries

**Get subgraph details**. We can check the latest block synced to the subgraph by querying `_meta`. Additionally, there is the `deployment` field, which provides us with the unique identifier for the subgraph deployment. Append it to `https://ipfsgw.com/ipfs/` to check the subgraph manifest content. `hasIndexingErrors` indicates where there have been any indexing errors.

<CodeGroup>
  ```graphql GraphQL
  {
    _meta {
      block {
        hash
        number
        parentHash
        timestamp
      }
      deployment
      hasIndexingErrors
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Queries for traders

### Swaps

**Get latest swaps**. Here, we query the `swaps` entity with a few parameters: `first` to limit the response size, `orderBy` and `orderDirection` to sort swaps by time in descending order.

<CodeGroup>
  ```graphql GraphQL
  {
    swaps(first: 5, orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc) {
      id
      transaction {
        id
        timestamp
      }
      pair {
        token0 {
          symbol
        }
        token1 {
          symbol
        }
      }
      amount0In
      amount1In
      amount0Out
      amount1Out
      amountUSD
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Get latest swaps for pair of tokens**. To obtain a pair address, you can call the `getPair` function of the [UniswapV2 Factory Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5c69bee701ef814a2b6a3edd4b1652cb9cc5aa6f#readContract) (no gas is needed). You can also query the subgraph using specific conditions, such as traded pairs with USDC (this will be covered later in the tutorial). Use `where` to filter the results.

<CodeGroup>
  ```graphql GraphQL
  {
    swaps(
      first: 5
      orderBy: timestamp
      orderDirection: desc
      where: {
        # WBTC/WETH pair
        pair_: { id: "0xbb2b8038a1640196fbe3e38816f3e67cba72d940" }
      }
    ) {
      id
      transaction {
        id
        timestamp
      }
      pair {
        token0 {
          symbol
        }
        token1 {
          symbol
        }
      }
      amount0In
      amount1In
      amount0Out
      amount1Out
      amountUSD
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Get the latest swaps with threshold**. In this case, we need to use the `amountUSD` field. In the Explorer, we can see there is a special field for this called `amountUSD_gte`. This field compares values to see if they are greater than or equal to a specified input.

<CodeGroup>
  ```graphql GraphQL
  {
    swaps(
      first: 5
      orderBy: timestamp
      orderDirection: desc
      where: { amountUSD_gte: 100000 }
    ) {
      id
      transaction {
        id
        timestamp
      }
      pair {
        token0 {
          symbol
        }
        token1 {
          symbol
        }
      }
      amount0In
      amount1In
      amount0Out
      amount1Out
      amountUSD
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Token prices

**Get token price**. To do this, we need to query the `token` entity with the argument `id` (token address). Since prices are in ETH, we should also include `ethPrice` from the `bundles` entity.

<CodeGroup>
  ```graphql GraphQL
  {
    # WBTC token address
    token(id: "0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599") {
      id
      symbol
      name
      derivedETH
    }

    bundles {
      ethPrice
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Get historical token prices**. Here, we can use `tokenDayDatas` , which stores historical data sets for all tokens. Prices are in USD.

<CodeGroup>
  ```graphql GraphQL
  {
    tokenDayDatas(
      first: 30
      orderBy: date
      orderDirection: desc
      # WBTC token address
      where: { token_: { id: "0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599" } }
    ) {
      date
      token {
        symbol
      }
      priceUSD
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Trading volume

**Get hourly trading volume of pair**. There is both daily and hourly data available. For our example, we will check the hourly data for the USDC/WETH pair (`id`) since July 1, 2024 (`hourStartUnix_gte`).

<CodeGroup>
  ```graphql GraphQL
  {
    pairHourDatas(
      # WBTC/WETH pair
      where: {
        pair_: { id: "0xbb2b8038a1640196fbe3e38816f3e67cba72d940" }
        hourStartUnix_gte: 1719788422
      }
      orderBy: hourStartUnix
      orderDirection: desc
    ) {
      hourStartUnix
      hourlyVolumeToken0
      hourlyVolumeToken1
      hourlyVolumeUSD
      hourlyTxns
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Get daily trading volume of a pair**. The same approach for querying daily data. Here, we retreive data for the last 7 days.

<CodeGroup>
  ```graphql GraphQL
  {
    pairDayDatas(
      # WBTC/WETH pair
      where: { pairAddress: "0xbb2b8038a1640196fbe3e38816f3e67cba72d940" }
      orderBy: date
      orderDirection: desc
      first: 7
    ) {
      date
      dailyVolumeUSD
      dailyTxns
      dailyVolumeToken0
      dailyVolumeToken1
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Queries for liquidity providers

### Pairs

**Get largest pairs**. The largest pairs have the largest reserves converted to USD. Sort by `reserveUSD` in descending order.

<CodeGroup>
  ```graphql GraphQL
  {
    pairs(orderBy: reserveUSD, orderDirection: desc, first: 10) {
      id
      createdAtTimestamp
      createdAtBlockNumber
      token0 {
        symbol
        id
      }
      token1 {
        symbol
        id
      }
      reserveUSD
      reserveETH
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Get recently created pools**. The most recent pools have the highest block number. Sort by `createdAtBlockNumber` in descending order.

<CodeGroup>
  ```graphql GraphQL
  {
    pairs(orderBy: createdAtBlockNumber, orderDirection: desc, first: 10) {
      id
      createdAtTimestamp
      createdAtBlockNumber
      token0 {
        symbol
        id
      }
      token1 {
        symbol
        id
      }
      reserveUSD
      reserveETH
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Liquidity positions and DEX metrics

**Get largest liquidity positions in pair**. We can filter by the `id` of the pair to get data for a specific pair. To find the largest positions, sort by `liquidityTokenBalance` in descending order.

<CodeGroup>
  ```graphql GraphQL
  {
    liquidityPositions(
      orderBy: liquidityTokenBalance
      orderDirection: desc
      first: 10
      # WBTC/WETH pair address
      where: { pair_: { id: "0xbb2b8038a1640196fbe3e38816f3e67cba72d940" } }
    ) {
      liquidityTokenBalance
      id
      pair {
        token0 {
          symbol
        }
        token1 {
          symbol
        }
        id
      }
      user {
        id
      }
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Get historical data on liquidity positions in pair**. Snapshots store historical data for liquidity positions. Sort by `block` in descending order, filtering for a specific pair.

<CodeGroup>
  ```graphql GraphQL
  {
    liquidityPositionSnapshots(
      orderBy: timestamp
      orderDirection: desc
      where: {
        # WBTC/WETH pair address
        pair_: { id: "0xbb2b8038a1640196fbe3e38816f3e67cba72d940" }
        liquidityTokenBalance_gt: "0"
      }
    ) {
      block
      liquidityTokenBalance
      timestamp
      id
      user {
        id
      }
      liquidityTokenTotalSupply
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Get Uniswap performance**. Uniswap data is accumulated and condensed into daily statistics in the `uniswapDayDatas` entity.

<CodeGroup>
  ```graphql GraphQL
  {
    uniswapDayDatas(first: 10, orderBy: date, orderDirection: desc) {
      date
      dailyVolumeETH
      dailyVolumeUSD
      totalLiquidityETH
      totalLiquidityUSD
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored various entities such as swaps, tokens, and liquidity positions, and how to query them using GraphQL and Python. Additionally, we provided examples of querying historical data and filtering results based on specific conditions. By following this tutorial, you can effectively interact with and analyze data from Uniswap V2 using Chainstack subgraphs.
