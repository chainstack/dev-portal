## Manage your buckets

A bucket is a logical container for organizing and storing your files.

A bucket can contain any number of files. You can also create folders and catalogs within buckets to further organize your data.

### Create a bucket

To create a bucket:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    On the left pane, click **IPFS Storage**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Create bucket**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Provide a name. Click **Create**.
  </Step>
</Steps>
This will create a bucket.

### Rename a bucket

To rename a bucket:
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Navigate to the list of your buckets.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Hover over the bucket you want to rename and click the three-dot icon > **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Enter a bucket's new name.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Save**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Delete a bucket

To delete a bucket:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Navigate to the list of your buckets.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Hover over the bucket you want to delete and click the three-dot icon > **Delete**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Yes, I'm sure**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Manage your folders

Within a bucket, you can optionally create a folder to organize your data. Folders are mutable virtual containers that don't get pinned in the IPFS network and have no CID of their own.

### Create a folder

To create a folder:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Click **Create folder**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Provide a name. Click **Create**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This will create a folder.

### Delete a folder

To delete a folder:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Navigate to the folder's location in your bucket.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Hover over the folder you want to delete and click the three-dot icon > **Delete**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Yes, I'm sure**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Upload a file

<Warning>
  ### Upload limit

  Current limit per 1 upload is 100MB.

  1 upload can contain any kind of objects: single files, multiple files, or a catalog.
</Warning>

You can upload data objects from your local machine or retrieve them directly off the IPFS network.

### Upload from your machine

To upload from your machine, within your bucket, click **Upload** and select one of the following:

* **Files** — to upload a single file or multiple files. Each of the files will get a separate CID.
* **Catalog** — to upload a combination of folders and files. The catalog itself and the files in it will get separate CIDs.

This will upload your objects through the Chainstack-hosted IPFS nodes to the Storj network. The file will be automatically pinned.

### Upload from the IPFS network

To upload from the IPFS network:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    In your bucket, click **Upload**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select **CID**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Provide the [content identifier](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/glossary/#cid) of a file that is available on the IPFS network.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This will retrieve the file by its CID off the IPFS network and upload it to the Storj network. The file will be automatically pinned.

## Create a dedicated gateway

IPFS dedicated gateways allow for faster and more reliable storage of files in the IPFS network. They have no rate or speed limitation and can be assigned either to a single bucket within an organization or provide access to the whole IPFS network.

To create a dedicated gateway, do the following:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Navigate to **IPFS Storage** > **Gateways**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Create dedicated gateway**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Select one of the following gateway modes:

   * **Private** — to create a gateway that will provide access to a single bucket within your organization.
   * **Open** — to create a gateway that will provide access to any data objects in the IPFS network.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    For the private mode, select a bucket to assign a gateway.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Enter the **Gateway name**. This name also will be used as a unique part of the gateway domain.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Create**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Retrieve your files

You can retrieve your files through a public or dedicated gateway provided by Chainstack or by using the IPFS tooling and your file's CID.

To retrieve through the public or dedicated gateway, on the Chainstack platform, navigate to your file and do one of the following:

* In the **Public gateway** field, click **Copy** or **Open** to get the link to your file through a public gateway.
* In the **Dedicated gateway** field, click **Copy** to get the link to your file through a dedicated gateway.

Retrieve using the file's CID:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    On the Chainstack platform, navigate to your file.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    In the **CID** field, click **Copy**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This will copy the file's CID that you can use to retrieve the file using [IPFS tools](https://github.com/ipfs/awesome-ipfs).
