title: "Manage your subgraphs"
---

**TLDR:**
* Easily view existing subgraphs in the Chainstack console, filtering by protocol and checking status and details like owner and region.
* Monitor deployment status (sync in progress, up-to-date, or failed) and progress in real time using logs for error, warning, and debug filters.
* Delete any subgraph directly from its details page to clean up your workspace.

<Note>
Subgraphs require a [paid plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) with the [pay-as-you-go](/docs/manage-your-billing#manage-the-pay-as-you-go-setting) setting enabled.

## View your subgraph

In [Subgraphs](https://console.chainstack.com/subgraphs), you can view a list of all existing subgraphs and can filter the view using the **Protocol** drop-down list.

Click on a subgraph to open the subgraph details. The subgraph details include such information as the **Owner**, **Creation date**, **Region**, and **Protocol**. You can view the **Metrics** to check the number of requests made in the subgraph, view the subgraph **Deployment command**, and the **Subgraph Query** URLs.

## Monitor your subgraph status

The status of a subgraph is displayed in the **Status** column of the [Subgraphs](https://console.chainstack.com/subgraphs) list. The status will be one of the following:

* **Not deployed** — this status is displayed when you create a subgraph in the console but not yet deployed a subgraph.
* **Deployed. Sync in progress** — the subgraph is in the process of being deployed and is syncing data.
* **Up-to-date** — the subgraph has been successfully deployed.
* **Failed** — the subgraph deployment was unsuccessful.

When you click on a subgraph and open the subgraph details, you will see more information about the progress of the subgraph at the top of the page. If the subgraph status is **Deployed. Sync in progress**, you can view the percentage completion and the quantity of data that has synced. You can click **Logs** for real-time status information about the progress of the sync. By default, the **Info** filter is selected, but you can also filter the logs by **Error**, **Warning**, and **Debug**, and can click **Load older logs** to change the time frame of the logs displayed.

## Delete a subgraph

To delete a subgraph, in the subgraph details page, click **Delete** and confirm by clicking **Yes, I am sure**. Your subgraph is deleted and you return to the [Subgraphs](https://console.chainstack.com/subgraphs) section of the console.
