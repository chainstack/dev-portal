<Warning>
**Chainstack Subgraphs is migrating to Ormi**

Effective immediately, you can no longer create new subgraphs on Chainstack. Existing subgraphs will continue to run until February 1, 2026, after which the service will be disabled.

To continue using subgraphs, migrate to [Ormi](https://ormilabs.com/) by following the [migration guide](https://docs.ormilabs.com/subgraphs/tutorials/migrate-chainstack-subgraphs). Migration requires only an endpoint change—no reindexing needed.
</Warning>

**TLDR:**
* Easily view existing subgraphs in the Chainstack console, filtering by protocol and checking status and details like owner and region.
* Monitor deployment status (sync in progress, up-to-date, or failed) and progress in real time using logs for error, warning, and debug filters.
* Delete any subgraph directly from its details page to clean up your workspace.

<Note>
Subgraphs require a [paid plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) with the [pay-as-you-go](/docs/manage-your-billing#manage-the-pay-as-you-go-setting) setting enabled.
</Note>

## View your subgraph

In [Subgraphs](https://console.chainstack.com/subgraphs), you can view a list of all existing subgraphs and can filter the view using the **Protocol** drop-down list.

Click on a subgraph to open the subgraph details. The subgraph details include such information as the **Owner**, **Creation date**, **Region**, and **Protocol**. You can view the **Metrics** to check the number of requests made in the subgraph, view the subgraph **Deployment command**, and the **Subgraph Query** URLs.

## Monitor your subgraph status

The status of a subgraph is displayed in the **Status** column of the [Subgraphs](https://console.chainstack.com/subgraphs) list. The status will be one of the following:

* **Not deployed** — this status is displayed when you create a subgraph in the console but not yet deployed a subgraph.
* **Deployed. Sync in progress** — the subgraph is in the process of being deployed and is syncing data.
* **Up-to-date** — the subgraph has been successfully deployed.
* **Failed** — the subgraph deployment was unsuccessful.

When you click on a subgraph and open the subgraph details, you will see more information about the progress of the subgraph at the top of the page. If the subgraph status is **Deployed. Sync in progress**, you can view the percentage completion and the quantity of data that has synced. You can click **Logs** for real-time status information about the progress of the sync. By default, the **Info** filter is selected, but you can also filter the logs by **Error**, **Warning**, and **Debug**, and can click **Load older logs** to change the time frame of the logs displayed.

## Delete a subgraph

To delete a subgraph, in the subgraph details page, click **Delete** and confirm by clicking **Yes, I am sure**. Your subgraph is deleted and you return to the [Subgraphs](https://console.chainstack.com/subgraphs) section of the console.
