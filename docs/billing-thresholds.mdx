description: "Understand how automatic charge thresholds work to manage your usage and payments"
---

Chainstack uses billing thresholds to help manage usage-based charges and ensure service continuity. This system automatically triggers payments when your accumulated usage reaches certain thresholds, preventing excessive unpaid usage while maintaining uninterrupted access to your services.

## How billing thresholds work

With metered billing, you're typically charged at the end of your billing cycle. However, if your accumulated usage reaches a billing threshold before the cycle ends, an automatic charge will be processed immediately. This helps:

- Prevent large unpaid balances from accumulating
- Ensure continuous service availability
- Protect both customers and Chainstack from unexpected overages

<Info>
Billing thresholds apply to metered pay-as-you-go usage charges, including API requests, dedicated node hours, warp transactions, subgraph usage and so on that exceed your plan's included allowances.

## Threshold levels by subscription plan

Each subscription plan has progressive billing thresholds. Once you reach a threshold, you'll be charged immediately for the accumulated usage, and the next threshold becomes active.

### How thresholds progress

The thresholds work progressively:

1. **First threshold** — when your usage reaches the first threshold amount for your plan, you're charged immediately
2. **Subsequent thresholds** — after each charge, the next higher threshold becomes active
3. **Final threshold** — once you reach the highest threshold for your plan, subsequent charges occur each time you accumulate that same amount again

<Note>
On the Developer plan, you'll be charged at `$10`, then at `$25` (additional `$15` from the first threshold), then at `$50` (additional `$25`), and so on. Once you reach the `$1,000` threshold, you'll be charged every time you accumulate another `$1,000` in usage.
</Note>

## Payment processing

When a billing threshold is reached:

1. **Automatic charge** — your payment method is charged immediately for the accumulated usage
2. **Balance priority** — your crypto balance is used first if available
3. **Credit card backup** — if your crypto balance is insufficient, your credit card is charged for the remaining amount
4. **Billing cycle continues** — your regular billing cycle remains unchanged; the threshold charge simply collects payment for usage to date

<Warning>
Ensure your payment methods are up to date to avoid service interruptions. Failed threshold payments may result in service suspension.
</Warning>

## Managing high usage

If you anticipate high usage that may trigger multiple thresholds:

- **Top up your crypto balance** — prepay to avoid frequent credit card charges
- **Monitor your usage** — track your current usage in the [Billing](https://console.chainstack.com/user/settings/billing) section
- **Contact support** — for custom threshold arrangements or enterprise billing needs

## Frequently asked questions

<Accordion title="Do billing thresholds reset each month?">
Yes, thresholds reset at the beginning of each billing cycle. You'll start again from the first threshold level for your plan.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I change my billing thresholds?">
Thresholds are tied to your subscription plan. Upgrading your plan will automatically update your thresholds to the new plan's levels. For custom threshold requirements, Enterprise customers can contact support.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if a threshold payment fails?">
If a threshold payment fails, you'll receive a notification and should update your payment method immediately. Continued failed payments may result in service suspension according to our [payment failure policy](/docs/manage-your-billing#settle-failed-payments).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are subscription fees subject to thresholds?">
No, billing thresholds apply only to metered usage charges. Your base subscription fee is always charged at the regular billing cycle.
</Accordion>
