This section outlines the fundamentals of and operations for Corda.

Learn what [networks](/docs/corda-operations#networks) you can join or deploy, [connect Corda Explorer](/docs/corda-operations#node-explorer) to your node, [install a CorDapp](/docs/corda-operations#installing-a-cordapp), and [interact with the node](/docs/corda-tooling) and the installed CorDapps.

## Networks

Chainstack supports joining the following Corda networks:

* [Corda Network](https://corda.network/) — the production Corda network
* [Corda Pre-Production Network](https://corda.network/participation/preprod) — the pre-production Corda network

See [Join a public network](/docs/manage-your-networks#join-a-public-network).

You can also deploy your own Corda network. See [Deploy a consortium network](/docs/deploy-a-consortium-network).

## Service nodes

A Corda network is deployed with the following service nodes:

* Notary — a [notary node](/docs/about-corda#notary-service)
* Network Map Service — a [network map service node](/docs/about-corda#network-map-service) running [Cordite Network Map Service](https://gitlab.com/cordite/network-map-service)

## Installing a CorDapp

You can install [CorDapps](/docs/about-corda#cordapp) on your nodes as a set of JAR files.

To install a CorDapp:
<Steps>
  <Step>
    On your node details page, click **CorDapps**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Install CorDapp**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Upload the contract, workflow, or a combined JAR file of your CorDapp.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Install**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Chainstack will reboot your node to complete the installation of your CorDapp.

## Node explorer

[The Corda Node Explorer](https://docs.corda.net/node-explorer.html) is a standalone JavaFX application.

With the Corda Node Explorer, you can:

* Find other nodes that are connected to the network.
* View your node's vault and transaction data.
* Execute cash transactions between parties on the network.

### Download and run the Node Explorer

[Download the Node Explorer](https://github.com/corda/node-explorer/releases) for your operating system.

### Connect to your node

In the Node Explorer UI, provide the RPC hostname and port, and your node credentials.

See [View node access details](/docs/manage-your-consortium-network#view-node-access-details).
