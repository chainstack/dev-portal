Ronin on a mix of Proof of Authority (PoA) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) to gradually become more decentralized with more PoA and less of DPoS.

## Consensus mechanism

### Initial setup: Proof of Authority (PoA)

Ronin initially employed PoA where transactions are verified by pre-selected validators, providing fast but centrally controlled validation.

### Transition to Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

To advance decentralization, Ronin has integrated DPoS, allowing token holders to delegate their stakes to validators, enhancing the democratic and decentralized validation process.

#### DPoS features:

* **Validator selection**: Validators are chosen through token holder votes, increasing their stakes and potential to be selected as validators.
* **Validator roles**: Consists of Governing Validators (selected through PoA) and Standard Validators (chosen through DPoS by token stake).
* **Block production**: Validators take turns producing blocks, maintaining elements of PoA for continuity.

### Validator dynamics

* **22 Validator slots**: 12 are Governing Validators, and 10 are open to any qualifying Standard Validators.
* **Daily updates**: Validator stakes are updated daily, with the top 10 by stake becoming Standard Validators.
* **Delegation**: Token holders can delegate stakes to influence validator selection.

### Staking and rewards

* **Token**: RON.
* **Minimum stake**: 250,000 RON to become a Validator Candidate.
* **Reward distribution**: Validators earn rewards from transaction fees and a portion of the staking rewards, distributed daily via smart contracts.

### Security measures

* **Clone attack prevention**: Requires a supermajority to confirm transactions, minimizing the risk of block height duplication attacks.
* **Slashing mechanisms**: Penalties for validators engaged in malicious activities, enhancing network integrity.

### Governance and operations

* **Bridge operators**: Manage asset transfers between Ronin and other EVM-compatible chains, with specific rewards and penalties.
* **Maintenance and unavailability**: Systems in place for maintenance modes and slashing for non-performance, ensuring operational continuity.

### Final remarks

Ronin's hybrid consensus approach, combining PoA and DPoS, aims to balance efficiency with increased decentralization, reflecting the evolving landscape of blockchain governance.
