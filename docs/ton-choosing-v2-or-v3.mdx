title: "TON: Choosing v2 or v3"
---

<Info>
  ### TON pricing is the same for full, archive, v2, v3

  There's no difference between a full node an archive node in data availability or pricing. All data is always available and all node requests are consumed as 1 request unit.
</Info>

Check out our [TON API reference](/api-reference/getting-started-ton), which has both v2 and v3 methods.

The question is—which one should you choose for your project?

As a reminder:

* TON API v2 endpoints serve real-time requests. TON API v2 requests serve off a node.
* TON API v3 endpoints serve indexed requests. TON API v3 requests serve off an indexer.

## Which one to choose

If speed and real-time freshness are crucial (for example, you need near-instant visibility of new transactions), go with v2.

If you need highly stable, processed, and precise data, and can tolerate a slight indexing delay—v3 is likely the better option.

Tip: If the data provided by v2 is sufficient for your use case, it should remain your best choice for simplicity and quick data access.

## Key differences detailed

### Indexing latency (data freshness)

**v2**: Delivers raw data more quickly, effectively providing the “freshest” data at any given moment. Feels more “native” because it uses the [ADNL protocol](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/network/protocols/adnl/overview) directly, which often lets it react faster to blockchain changes.

**v3**: Performs additional data processing and indexing. As a result, it may have a slight lag compared to raw data sources. Offers well-structured and cleaned data, which can be advantageous for complex queries. If ultra-fresh data is a priority (for instance, if you need to see changes at near real-time), use v2 tends to have the edge.

### Request latency

Our TON RPC node network is global and we strive to always have the shortest travel time for your requests based on our highly tuned infrastructure.
