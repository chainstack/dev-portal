# MCP servers

Chainstack provides [Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) to enhance AI-driven blockchain development workflows. MCP is an open protocol that enables AI applications to securely connect to external data sources and tools.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that provides a unified way for AI applications to connect to external data sources, tools, and services. MCP servers act as intermediaries that expose specific capabilities to AI models in a secure and controlled manner.

What this means in practice is you can run locally the Chainstack MCP servers and enable access to them in your AI applications like Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, etc. Your AI applications will then call MCP servers whenever they deem necessary and get immediate access to the Chainstack Developer Portal or the supported chains via the Chainstack RPC nodes with the JSON-RPC method calls.

## Chainstack MCP servers

Chainstack ships **two distinct MCP servers** to support different blockchain development needs:

### 1. Developer Portal MCP server

The **Developer Portal MCP server** is built into Chainstack's documentation platform and provides AI models with access to Chainstack's comprehensive blockchain development resources.

**Installation:**
```bash
npx mint-mcp add chainstack
```

This MCP server gives AI models access to:
- Chainstack's documentation and guides
- API references and examples
- Best practices for blockchain development
- Protocol-specific information and tooling guidance

### 2. RPC Nodes MCP server

The **RPC Nodes MCP server** provides direct blockchain interaction capabilities for Solana and EVM-compatible networks through Chainstack's infrastructure.

**Repository:** [chainstacklabs/rpc-nodes-mcp](https://github.com/chainstacklabs/rpc-nodes-mcp)

This MCP server enables AI models to:
- Execute blockchain RPC calls
- Query account balances and transaction data
- Interact with smart contracts
- Access real-time blockchain information
- Perform cross-chain operations

The RPC Nodes MCP server is split into specialized components:
- **EVM MCP server** - For Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks
- **Solana MCP server** - For the Solana blockchain

## Getting started

Choose the MCP server that best fits your AI application needs:

- **Use the Developer Portal MCP server** when you need AI models to access Chainstack's documentation, guides, and development resources
- **Use the RPC Nodes MCP server** when you need AI models to directly interact with blockchain networks and execute transactions

Both servers can be used together to create comprehensive blockchain-powered AI applications that combine educational resources with real-time blockchain functionality.
