## Organization

An organization is the hierarchical ancestor of all your projects and nodes at Chainstack. When you first sign up with Chainstack, an organization is automatically created for you and you become the Owner user of this organization.

## Requirements for an existing user to accept an invitation to another organization

If you already belong to an organization on Chainstack, you can accept an invitation to join a different organization only when all of the following conditions are met:

- Single‑member organization — You are the sole user in your current organization.
— Plan tier — Your account is on the [Developer plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/).
— Positive or zero balance — Your [billing balance](/docs/manage-your-billing) is not negative.
- No add‑ons — You have no [add-ons enabled](/docs/add-ons).
- No active infrastructure — You have no nodes and no subgraphs deployed.

## Users and their roles

A user is an account invited to become a part of an organization.

Each user in an organization can be assigned one of the following roles:

* Admin — the role can access and change the organization's billing settings, invite users, create and delete projects, deploy and delete nodes and networks, change user roles.
* Editor — the role can create and delete projects, deploy and delete nodes and networks.
* Viewer — the role can view existing projects, nodes, and networks.

<Info>
  ### Is Owner a separate role?

  Owner is a special tag for a user who created the organization. Owner users have the same rights as Admin users but cannot change their role.
