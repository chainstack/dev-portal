title: "Debug & Trace APIs"
description: "Debug and trace APIs allow Web3 developers to monitor, trace, and debug the activities that occur within blockchain networks."
---

## Overview

They provide detailed information about transactions, blocks, and smart contracts execution making it easier to identify and resolve issues within decentralized applications.

By using debug and trace APIs, developers can build more reliable and secure DApps with improved user experience and thus contribute to the overall health of a network.

  ### Historical states limitations

  To debug and trace transactions, you need to have historical states on the node. Full nodes of different protocols can [store different amount of historical states](/docs/protocols-modes-and-types#modes). At the same time, archive nodes keep historical states for the *entire chain*.

## Protocols with debug and trace APIs

### Ethereum

To enable debug and trace APIs on your Ethereum node, you must have a [paid plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) and deploy the node as a [global node.](/docs/global-elastic-node)

#### Dedicated nodes

To enable debug and trace APIs on your dedicated Ethereum node, you must have a [paid plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/). Dedicated nodes can be deployed either as the Geth or Erigon client implementation for the full and archive modes respectively, however, they slightly differ from each other:

* With a node running on Geth, only `debug_*`namespace is exposed.
* With a node running on Erigon, both `debug_*` and `trace_*`namespaces are exposed.

Learn how to [deploy your dedicated Ethereum node run on different clients](/api-reference/enable-debug-trace-apis-for-your-ethereum-node#dedicated-ethereum-node) with debug and trace APIs enabled.

For the full list of the available debug and trace API methods, see:

### Polygon

To enable debug and trace APIs on your Polygon node, you must have a [paid plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) and deploy the node as a [global node.](/docs/global-elastic-node)

#### Dedicated nodes

To enable debug and trace APIs on your dedicated Polygon node, you must have a [paid plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/). Dedicated nodes can be deployed either as the Bor or Erigon client implementation for the full and archive modes respectively, however, they slightly differ from each other:

* With a node running on Bor, only `debug_*`namespace is exposed.
* With a node running on Erigon, both `debug_*` and `trace_*`namespaces are exposed.

For the full list of the available debug and trace API methods, see: [Erigon: RPC implementation status](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/blob/stable/cmd/rpcdaemon/README.md#rpc-implementation-status)

### BNB Smart Chain

To enable debug and trace APIs on your BNB Smart Chain node, you must have a [paid plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) and deploy the node as a [global node.](/docs/global-elastic-node)

#### Dedicated nodes

To enable debug and trace APIs on your dedicated BNB Smart Chain node, you must have a [paid plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/). Dedicated nodes can be deployed either as the Geth or Erigon client implementation for the full and archive modes respectively, however, they slightly differ from each other:

* With a node running on Geth, only `debug_*`namespace is exposed.

### Base

To enable debug and trace APIs on your Base node, you must have a [paid plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) and deploy the node as a [global node.](/docs/global-elastic-node)

### Avalanche

To enable debug and trace APIs on your Avalanche node, you must have a [paid plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) and deploy the node in the [archive mode](/docs/protocols-modes-and-types#modes). Your node will run the AvalancheGo client, which is the Go language implementation of an Avalanche node. Avalanche offers an API interface identical to [Geth's API](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server), but with a limited set of services that include `debug_trace*`.

For a full list of the Geth debug API methods, see the [Debug namespace](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/ns-debug) section of the Geth documentation.

You can deploy a dedicated Avalanche node starting from a [paid plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/).

### Arbitrum

To enable debug and trace APIs on your Arbitrum node, you must have a [paid plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) and deploy the node as a [global node.](/docs/global-elastic-node)

#### Dedicated nodes

To enable debug and trace APIs on your dedicated Arbitrum node, you must have a [paid plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/).

#### Available methods

Both and dedicated Arbitrum nodes with debug and trace APIs enabled will expose the `debug_*` and `arbtrace_*` methods.

Blocks older than 22,207,815th were added to the chain before [Nitro migration](https://developer.arbitrum.io/migration/dapp_migration) and cannot be queried with Geth methods. Starting from block 22,207,815, Arbitrum migrated to Nitro which made Geth `debug_*` methods available for newer blocks.

Use the following methods for calling on blocks prior to 22,207,815:

* arbtrace\_call
* arbtrace\_callMany
* arbtrace\_replayBlockTransactions
* arbtrace\_replayTransaction
* arbtrace\_transaction
* arbtrace\_get
* arbtrace\_block
* arbtrace\_filter

For the full list of the available `debug_*` namespace methods, see [Geth documentation](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/ns-debug).

### zkSync Era

To enable debug and trace APIs on your zkSync Era node, you must deploy an node in the archive mode. The node will expose the `debug_*` API methods. A debug and trace node for zkSync Era is available starting from a [paid plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/).

## Usage examples

You can debug and trace transactions by replaying them in the Ethereum Virtual Machine to get the execution details in the exact same way as they happened on the chain.

### debug\_traceBlockByNumber

Trace all transactions included in a block with `debug_traceBlockByNumber` in [block 14,976,695](https://etherscan.io/txsInternal?block=14976695):

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl 'YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"id": 1, "method": "debug_traceBlockByNumber", "params": ["0xE486B7", {"tracer": "callTracer"}]}'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where

* `0xE486B7` — the number of the block to get the traces of included transactions. For Geth, you need to provide the block number in hex.
* YOUR\_CHAINSTACK\_ENDPOINT — your Chainstack node HTTPS endpoint. See [View node access and credentials](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).
