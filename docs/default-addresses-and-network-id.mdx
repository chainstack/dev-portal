## Default addresses

When you deploy a Quorum network with Chainstack, the very first address that comes with the first node has the default Quorum balance of `1000000000000000000000000000`.

All subsequent nodes are deployed with the addresses with the balance `0`.

## Default network ID

The default network ID of your Quorum network deployed with Chainstack is `10001`.
