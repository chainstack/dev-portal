title: "TRON tooling"
description: "TRON blockchain development tools guide. Use TronWeb.js, web3.py, MetaMask, Hardhat, Remix IDE, and Foundry with Chainstack TRON nodes and endpoints."
---

<Info>
  ### `/jsonrpc`, `/wallet`, `/walletsolidty` support

  Chainstack supports all three method endpoints:

  * `/jsonrpc`
  * `/wallet`
  * `/walletsoldity`

  Note that the TRON nodes provided are full only (non-archive), which makes some of the methods unsupported.
</Info>

Get started with a [reliable TRON RPC endpoint](https://chainstack.com/build-better-with-tron/) to use the tools below.

For the full API reference, see the official [TRON API Reference](https://developers.tron.network/reference/).

<Note>
  ### WebSocket event subscription not available
  
  TRON nodes currently do not support WebSocket connections for event subscriptions. If you need to subscribe to events, please vote and follow the feature request at [TRON event plugin support](https://ideas.chainstack.com/p/implement-tron-event-plugin).
</Note>

## MetaMask

On [node access details](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials), click **Connect wallet**.

## web3.py

Build DApps using [web3.py](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py) and TRON nodes deployed with Chainstack.

1. Install [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/).

2. Connect over HTTP. See also [EVM node connection: HTTP vs WebSocket](https://support.chainstack.com/hc/en-us/articles/900002187586-Ethereum-node-connection-HTTP-vs-WebSocket).

### HTTP

Use the `HTTPProvider` to connect to your node endpoint and get the latest block number.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Key Protected
  from web3 import Web3

  web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT'))
  print(web3.eth.block_number)
  ```

  ```python Password Protected
  from web3 import Web3

  web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('https://%s:%s@%s'% ("USERNAME", "PASSWORD", "HOSTNAME")))
  print(web3.eth.block_number)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where

* YOUR\_CHAINSTACK\_ENDPOINT — your node HTTPS endpoint protected either with the key or password

See also [node access details](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).

## TronWeb.js

See [TronWeb](https://tronweb.network/).

Example of doing a `getBalance` call:

```js
const { TronWeb } = require('tronweb');

const tronWeb = new TronWeb({
    fullHost: 'YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT'
});

const address = 'TWiEv2wfqQ8FkbAJ6bXt1uA2Uav9ZWvXip';

async function getBalance() {
    try {

        const balanceInSun = await tronWeb.trx.getBalance(address);

        const balanceInTRX = tronWeb.fromSun(balanceInSun);
        
        console.log(`Address: ${address}`);
        console.log(`Balance in SUN: ${balanceInSun}`);
        console.log(`Balance in TRX: ${balanceInTRX}`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error getting balance:', error);
    }
}

getBalance(); 
```

where

* YOUR\_CHAINSTACK\_ENDPOINT — your TRON node **base** endpoint without the `/jsonrpc`, `/wallet`, or `/walletsolidity` postfixes.

## Hardhat

Configure [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) to deploy contracts and interact through your Klaytn nodes.

1. Install [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and create a project.

2. Create a new environment in `hardhat.config.js`:

   ```javascript
   require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");
   ...
   module.exports = {
     solidity: "0.7.3",
     networks: {
       chainstack: {
           url: "YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT",
           accounts: ["YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"]
       },
     }
   };
   ```

   where

   * YOUR\_CHAINSTACK\_ENDPOINT — your node HTTPS or WSS endpoint protected either with the key or password. See [node access details](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).
   * YOUR\_PRIVATE\_KEY — the private key of the account that you use to deploy the contract

3. Run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network chainstack` and Hardhat will deploy using Chainstack.

See also [Forking EVM-compatible mainnet with Hardhat](https://support.chainstack.com/hc/en-us/articles/900004242406).

## Remix IDE

To make Remix IDE interact with the network through a Chainstack node:

1. Get [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and set it to interact through a Chainstack node. See [Interacting through MetaMask](#metamask).

2. In Remix IDE, navigate to the **Deploy** tab. Select **Injected Provider - MetaMask** in **Environment**.

This will engage MetaMask and make Remix IDE interact with the network through a Chainstack node.

## Foundry

1. Install [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/).

2. Use `--rpc-url` to run the operation through your Chainstack node.

### Forge

Use `forge` to develop, test, and deploy your smart contracts.

To deploy a contract:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  forge create CONTRACT_NAME --contracts CONTRACT_PATH --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where

* CONTRACT\_NAME — name of the contract in the Solidity source code
* CONTRACT\_PATH — path to your smart contract
* YOUR\_PRIVATE\_KEY — the private key to your funded account that you will use to deploy the contract
* YOUR\_CHAINSTACK\_ENDPOINT — your node HTTPS endpoint protected either with the key or password

### Cast

Use `cast` to interact with the network and the deployed contracts.

To get the latest block number:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  cast block-number --rpc-url YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where YOUR\_CHAINSTACK\_ENDPOINT is your node HTTPS endpoint protected either with the key or password
