## Types

Chainstack supports 2 types of nodes for public chains: elastic node and dedicated node. Elastic nodes are available for all networks by default. To get a dedicated node, you'll have to contact us directly.

## Modes

For most of the available public chains, Chainstack supports deploying nodes in the following modes:

* Full — a node that stores full blockchain data. However, it has limitations to how many blocks are available for querying.
* Archive — a node that stores full blockchain data and an archive of historical states, which makes it possible to query any block since the chain genesis.
* Trader — a node that propagates transactions to the global mempool at high speed. See [Trader nodes](/docs/warp-transactions).
