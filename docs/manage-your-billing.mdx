   ### 150+ cryptocurrencies

   Chainstack supports topping up your balance with 150+ cryptocurrencies.
</Info>

 Your crypto balance is the first to be charged for subscription, support, and node usage costs. If the balance is insufficient, your credit card will be charged for the outstanding amount.

 The billing page is available for users with the [Admin role](/docs/manage-your-organization#users-and-their-roles). Here you can:

 * Top up your balance.
 * Edit your credit card details.
 * Check for failed payments and settle them.
 * View your current metered usage by category and its cost.
 * Manage your organization subscription plan and support level.

 ## Manage the pay-as-you-go setting

 With the pay-as-you-go setting enabled in your [Billing](https://console.chainstack.com/user/settings/billing), your Chainstack services will stay operational on reaching your plan's quota limit. Going over the limit will trigger the pay-as-you-go charges.

 With the pay-as-you-go setting disabled, you introduce a hard limit to your plan. On reaching the quota, your Chainstack services will stop and you won't be charged on going over the limit.

 In both cases, you will receive at least two email notifications—on using up 80% of your plan's quota and on using up 100%.

 ## Top up your balance with crypto

 You can top up your balance with your Coinbase account or directly with cryptocurrency.

 If there's a token that you'd like to top up with, it's most likely supported. See the [150+ supported tokens and coins](https://nowpayments.io/supported-coins) with NOWPayments.

 ### Top up with a Coinbase account or wallet

 To top up the balance with your Coinbase account:

 1. Go to [Billing](https://console.chainstack.com/user/settings/billing).
2. Click **Top up**.
3. Click **Crypto**.
4. Pick an amount to top up with
5. Click **Coinbase Commerce**.

 Proceed to pay with a Coinbase account or any of your non-custodial wallets.

 ### Top up with NOWPayments

1. Go to [Billing](https://console.chainstack.com/user/settings/billing).
2. Click **Top up**.
3. Click **Crypto**.
4. Click **NOWPayments**.
5. Pick an amount to top up with.
6. Pick a token to pay with. Proceed to pay

 ### Top up with a non-custodial wallet

 You can top up the balance using your preferred non-custodial wallet. For example, [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet), and others.

 To top up the balance with a non-custodial wallet:

1. Go to [Billing](https://console.chainstack.com/user/settings/billing).
2. Click **Top up with crypto**.
3. Select a predefined amount or type in your amount. Click **Next**.
4. Select the cryptocurrency.
5. Send the cryptocurrency to the respective generated address.

 ## Edit your credit card details

 If you need to edit your credit card details, do the following:

1. Go to [Billing](https://console.chainstack.com/user/settings/billing).
2. Next to **Credit card**, click **Edit**.
3. Enter new details.
4. Click **Update**.

 The billing page will reload automatically and show your new credit card details.

 ## Settle failed payments

 If both the crypto balance and credit card deduction tries were unsuccessful, a payment is considered failed.

 Your Chainstack services get suspended on the first failed payment attempt or remain operational for three days depending on the plan level and your API calls will stop processing as a result. Your Chainstack endpoints will remain the same and will be back to operational when the failed payments are settled. If the failed payments are not settled within 14 days after the first failed attempt, your Chainstack endpoints will be deleted.

 There are the following ways to settle failed payments:

 * Add a new credit card. If its balance is sufficient, failed payments will be deducted automatically.
 * Retry your payment manually and deduct the due amount either from your balance or credit card.

 To retry your payment manually:

 1. Make sure that a payment method of your choice has sufficient funds.

 2. Go to [Billing](https://console.chainstack.com/user/settings/billing) > **Balance**.

 3. Next to the failed payment, click **Retry with** and select one of the following:

    * **Credit card** — to deduct the amount due from a credit card linked to your account.
    * **Balance** — to deduct the amount due from your crypto balance. See how to [top it up](/docs/manage-your-billing#top-up-your-balance-with-crypto).

 The amount due will be deducted from your crypto or credit card balance and the payment status will change to **Paid**.

 ## Manage your organization subscription plan and support level

 You can manage two major options of your organization billing:

 * Your subscription plan
 * Your support level

 Chainstack offers four types of subscription plans which differ depending on your Web3 objectives. The final price of each subscription plan is made up of a base charge for the features included and the number of API requests made to your deployed nodes.

 [Each subscription plan also has a default support level](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) included into it. You can change your subscription plan any time, while the support level can be changed only for paid subscriptions. Switching between subscription plans and support levels occurs independently from each other.

 ### Changing your subscription plan

 To change your subscription plan:

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Billing**.
2. Next to **Plan**, click **Change**.
3. Select a new subscription plan and click **Next**.
4. Check the details of your new subscription plan and click **Confirm**.

 Your subscription plan changes immediately. Funds for the unused period of your previous subscription will be automatically returned to your balance. You will also be billed for any uninvoiced metered usage during the used period of your previous subscription.

<Warning>
  ### Rate limits for Developer plans

  A free Developer plan has a rate limit of 30 request per second. However, this does not affect paid subscription plans.
</Warning>

### Changing your support level

 To change your support level:

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Billing**.
2. Next to **Support level**, click **Change**.
3. Select a new support level and click **Next**.
4. Check the details of your new support level and click **Confirm**.

 Your support level changes immediately. Funds that you haven’t spent during your previous upgrade option will be automatically used as a part of your new support level charge if it’s Professional or returned to your balance if you have switched to Standard.

 ## Chainstack Subgraphs billing details

 You can view your Chainstack Subgraphs usage details in the **Usage** section. The **Subgraphs requests** table provides the number of requests included in your plan, the number that you have used, and the number that you have used in excess of your allowance. The **Total subgraph hours** shows the total number of hours that your subgraphs have been active.

 For information about how to change your Chainstack subscription plan to increase your allowance of included requests, see [Manage your organization subscription plan and support level](#manage-your-organization-subscription-plan-and-support-level).

 ## Chainstack Marketplace billing details

 The Chainstack Marketplace is a collection of applications, including add-ons, plugins, and tools designed to extend the functionality of your nodes and infrastructure. Each application may have its own pricing model—such as free, subscription-based, or one-time payment—which is billed separately and in addition to your main Chainstack subscription plan. If a paid application is removed before the end of its billing cycle, a partial refund will be issued for the unused portion of the subscription.
