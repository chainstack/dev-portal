title: "MEV protection"
description: "With  on, your mainnet transaction is redirected to a partner network that works directly with block builders. This approach bypasses the public mempool, helping protect against front-running attacks."

This currently applies to:

### How it works

1. You construct and sign your transaction as usual and send it through our endpoint. This is sent as `eth_sendRawTransaction`.
2. Instead of broadcasting to the global mempool, our proxy forwards it to the partner network for direct inclusion consideration by block builders.
3. A builder includes your transaction in a block. Once confirmed, it appears on-chain as normal.

If you have the transaction hash, you can retrieve it from the private pool with the regular [eth\_getTransactionByHash](/reference/ethereum_node_api/transaction_info/eth_getTransactionByHash) but only through the same Chainstack node endpoint you used to submit the transaction.

Once the transaction is in the block, you can retrieve it using all regular methods, of course:

  <Card title="eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex" icon="angle-right" iconType="solid" horizontal href="/reference/ethereum_node_api/transaction_info/eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex"/>
</CardGroup>

and so on.

### Benefits

* Reduced front-running risk — your transaction isn’t visible in the public mempool, minimizing the chance of adversary trades.
* Reliable delivery — direct builder routes ensure predictable inclusion.

### Opting out

If you prefer the traditional public mempool route, you can disable private routing. Just switch **MEV protection** to off on the node details page.
