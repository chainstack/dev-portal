Each extra transaction (not request, just the transaction) consumed is billed separately. For details, see [Pricing](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) .

See also the [Solana Warp transactions](https://chainstack.com/solana-trader-nodes/) page for a more general overview.

Note that Warp transactions only work over the HTTP protocol. The WebSocket protocol is not supported.

## Overview

The Chainstack Solana Trader nodes with Warp transactions offer the following benefits:

* All requests, except `sendTransaction`, go through the highly reliable & balanced Chainstack Solana node. The `sendTransaction` request is routed through the [bloXroute Trader API](https://bloxroute.com/products/solana-trader-api/).
* No need to craft custom transaction instructions or change your regular trading setup if it's using standard Solana nodes.
* All `sendTransaction` requests (i.e., all transactions) are sent to the current leader through a staked validator connection.
* 40% of transactions land in the first two blocks.
* Front-running protection is not enabled, as it would reduce transaction processing speed.
* You can use [priority fees](/docs/solana-how-to-priority-fees-faster-transactions) to increase the chances of getting earlier placement within a block and in earlier blocks.
* Warp transactions (not requests, just the transactions) consumed are billed separately. For details, see [Pricing](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) with the [pay-as-you-go](/docs/manage-your-billing) setting enabled.

## No need for custom setups

If you have a trading project setup that's using regular Solana nodes, to transform your project to a high-speed one with all the benefits, all you need to do is swap the Solana node endpoint to the Chainstack Trader node with Warp transactions endpoint.

Just doing that will immediately have your project have 40% of your transactions within the first two blocks and so on.

All your project requests will be going through the Chainstack Solana nodes with the exception of the `sendTransaction` requests that will be routed through the bloXroute infrastructure.

This means that you get the best of both worlds at zero additional effort from you:

* If you were using bloXroute alone, you'd have to craft your custom non-standard transaction that'd have to include instructions for memos and tips to successfully propagate and land through bloXroute.
* If you were using a regular Solana node setup, you'd get no benefits of bloXroute solution.

## SwQoS

Transactions get the SwQoS landing rate as they are submitted through some of the biggest SwQoS Solana validators.

You can read more on what SwQoS is: [A Guide to Stake-weighted Quality of Service on Solana](https://solana.com/developers/guides/advanced/stake-weighted-qos).

And check the bloXroute SwQoS infrastructure: [What are the benefits of sending transactions through bloXroute Solana Trader API](https://docs.bloxroute.com/solana/trader-api-v2/wiki/faq#q-what-are-the-benefits-of-sending-transactions-through-bloxroute-solana-trader-api-1).

## Speed metrics

The speed metrics are tricky, especially on an extremely fast chain like Solana. These are easily influenced by latency (e.g., how far your bot is from the actual node and routing gate location), priority fees, and so on.

Note that the metrics below are done **without high priority fees** to provide you with a base expectation to work from.

That said, here's some of the rough metrics that you can start with:

* 75% of the transactions are included in less than 5 blocks:

  * 37% within 2 blocks
  * 79% within 4 blocks
  * 95% within 6 blocks
  * 98% within 8 blocks
  * 99% within 10 blocks

Again, keep in mind that you can greatly impact these numbers with your trading project actual location and priority fees.

## No front running protection

The transactions do not have the front running protection enabled. Enabling front running protection would limit the number validators that can get the transaction (to protect it from front running), which in turn will delay the transaction.

Not to sacrifice the speed, the front running protection is disabled.

That said, utilizing the bloXroute infrastructure for your transactions puts in you in the very top of users and greatly reduces the front running opportunities for your adversaries.

## Priority fees for extra speed

Using priority fees increases your chances of being included in the first two blocks, including getting in the first block and getting early in order of transactions in the block.
