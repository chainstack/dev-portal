description: "Complete Solana tooling guide for Chainstack nodes. Use Solana CLI, web3.js, solana.py, JSON-RPC API, and Backpack wallet to interact with Solana blockchain."
---

<Note>
Chainstack Solana nodes have Jito ShredStream enabled by default, providing enhanced performance for the [Yellowstone gRPC Geyser plugin](/docs/yellowstone-grpc-geyser-plugin).
</Note>

Get started with a [reliable Solana RPC endpoint](https://chainstack.com/build-better-with-solana/) to use the tools below.

## Solana tool suite
1. Install the Solana tool suite. See [Install the Solana Tool Suite](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).

2. Connect the Solana tool suite to the Chainstack-deployed Solana node:

   ```shell
   solana config set --url YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT
   ```

   where YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT is your node HTTPS or WSS endpoint protected either with the key or password. See [node access details](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).

3. Run the Solana [client commands](https://docs.solana.com/cli).

   Example to get the block height:

   ```shell
   $ solana block-height
   106318062
   ```
<Info>
  ### WebSocket endpoint

  When you set the HTTPS endpoint with `solana config set`, the tool will also set a computed WebSocket endpoint, which is incorrect.

  To use WebSocket, you must set the WebSocket explicitly with `--ws`.

  Example:

  Shell

  ```
  solana config set --ws YOUR_CHAINSTACK_WSS_ENDPOINT
  ```
</Info>

## JSON-RPC API

Interact with your Solana network using [JSON-RPC API](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api).

Use [curl](https://curl.haxx.se) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com).

Example to get account balance:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"getBalance","params":["23dQfKhhsZ9RA5AAn12KGk21MB784PmTB3gfKRwdBNHr"],"id":1}' \
    YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT
  ```
</CodeGroup>

where YOUR\_CHAINSTACK\_ENDPOINT is your node HTTPS or WSS endpoint protected either with the key or password. See [node access details](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).

## Solana web3.js

1. Install Solana web3.js. See [Solana web3.js guide](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/javascript-api).

2. Use `Connection` to connect to your Solana node and get account balance:

   ```javascript
   const web3 = require("@solana/web3.js");
   (async () => {
     const publicKey = new web3.PublicKey(
       '23dQfKhhsZ9RA5AAn12KGk21MB784PmTB3gfKRwdBNHr'
     );
     const connect = new web3.Connection('YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT');
     console.log(await connect.getBalance(publicKey));
   })();
   ```

   where YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT is your node HTTPS or WSS endpoint protected either with the key or password. See [node access details](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).
## Solana.py

1. Install [Solana.py](https://github.com/michaelhly/solana-py).

2. Use `Client` to connect to your Solana node and get account balance:

   ```python
   from solana.rpc.api import Client
   from solana.publickey import PublicKey
   client = Client('YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT')
   print(client.get_balance(PublicKey('23dQfKhhsZ9RA5AAn12KGk21MB784PmTB3gfKRwdBNHr')))
   ```

   where YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT is your node HTTPS or WSS endpoint protected either with the key or password. See [node access details](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).
## Backpack wallet

[Backpack](https://backpack.app/) is one of the few (if not the only) Solana wallets allowing to add a custom RPC node endpoint.

You should use your own Solana RPC node for enterprise-grade reliability, not to fall victim to a sudden network congestion, or if you want to use your own [Trader node](/docs/warp-transactions) .

To add your own Solana RPC node endpoint to your Backpack wallet:

1. Open your Backpack wallet.
2. Click the account icon > **Settings**.
3. Click **Solana** > **RPC connection** > **Custom**.
4. Enter your Chainstack Solana node endpoint and hit **Update**.

Congrats, now you are safe with reliable network access.
