title: "Ethereum: Asset tokenization with Embark"
---

**TLDR:**
* You’ll build a simple contract in Embark that tokenizes assets with a fixed supply of 1,000 tokens.
* You’ll set a price of 0.1 ether per token and let anyone exchange ether for asset tokens on Sepolia.
* You’ll use Chainstack to deploy and run your own Sepolia node, and Geth to manage your accounts.
* You’ll confirm everything works by testing the contract with Embark’s Cockpit and by sending ether from MetaMask.

## Main article

This tutorial will guide you through creating a tokenized asset contract and deploying it on Sepolia testnet.

For illustration purposes, this contract does the following:

* Creates a total supply of 1,000 tokens specific to the asset.
* Sets the token price to 0.1 ether.
* Let anyone exchange ether for asset tokens. This tutorial uses [Embark](https://framework.embarklabs.io/) to test and deploy the contract.

## Prerequisites

* [Chainstack account](https://console.chainstack.com/) to deploy a Sepolia testnet node.
* [Embark](https://framework.embarklabs.io/) to test and deploy the contract.
* [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/) to create an Ethereum account that will deploy the contract.
* [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) to interact with the contract.

## Step-by-step

### Create a public chain project

See [Create a project](/docs/manage-your-project#create-a-project).

### Deploy a Sepolia node

See [Join a public network](/docs/manage-your-networks#join-a-public-network).

### Get Sepolia testnet ether from a faucet

In your MetaMask, fund each account with Sepolia ether [Chainstack's Sepolia faucet](https://faucet.chainstack.com).

### Create an Embark project and the contract

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Create a new Embark project:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash Shell
     embark new asset
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   This will create an Embark directory called `asset`.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Change to the `contracts` directory of the Embark project.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Create an `AssetTokenized.sol` file in the `contracts` directory:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```solidity solidity
     pragma solidity = 0.5.0;

     contract AssetTokenized{
     uint public supply;
     uint public pricePerEth;
     mapping( address => uint ) public balance;

     constructor() public {
         supply = 1000;                    // There are a total of 1000 tokens for this asset
         pricePerEth = 100000000000000000; // One token costs 0.1 ether
       }

       function check() public view returns(uint) {
         return balance[msg.sender];
       }

       function () external payable {
         balance[msg.sender] += msg.value/pricePerEth; // adds asset tokens to how much ether is sent by the investor
         supply -= msg.value/pricePerEth;              //subtracts the remaining asset tokens from the total supply
       }
     }
     ```
   </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Create an Ethereum account

You will use this account to deploy the contract.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Create the account:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash Shell
     geth account new
     ```
   </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Check the path to the keystore file created for the new account:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash Shell
     geth account list
     ```
   </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Import the account in MetaMask and fund the account

<Steps>
  <Step>
    In MetaMask, click **Import Account** > **JSON File.**
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select the keystore file that you created earlier.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Fund the account with [Sepolia ether](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Deploy the contract

<Steps>
  <Step>
    In your Embark project directory, change to `config`.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Append `contracts.js` with the following configuration:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```js JavaScript
     chainstack: {
       deployment:{
         accounts: [
             {
               privateKeyFile:"//root/.ethereum/keystore/UTC--2019-08-01T07-24-17.754471456Z- -73236c8d8aaee5263e8a32c71171030dd7a3e8e6",
               password:"PASSWORD"
             }
         ],
         host:"YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT",
         port:false,
         protocol:"https",
         type:"rpc"
       },
       dappConnection: [
         "$WEB3",  // uses pre-existing Web3 object if available (e.g in Mist)
         "ws://localhost:8546",
         "<http://localhost:8545>"
       ],
       gas: "auto",
     }
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   where

   * `//root/.ethereum/keystore/...` — the location of the keystore file
   * PASSWORD — the password you provided when creating the Ethereum account with Geth
   * YOUR\_CHAINSTACK\_ENDPOINT — your Chainstack node endpoint. See also [View node access and credentials](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Deploy the contract with Embark:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash Shell
     embark run chainstack
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   where `chainstack` — the argument from the configuration file `contracts.js`

   This will deploy the contract on Sepolia.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Check the contract with Cockpit

On contract deployment, Embark runs Cockpit which is a front-end application to test the contract.

In your browser, open:

`<http://localhost:55555/explorer/contracts/CONTRACT_NAME>`

where CONTRACT\_NAME — the name of your contract. In this tutorial, the path is `<http://localhost:55555/explorer/contracts/AssetTokenized>`.

This will also display the contract address in the `Deployed at` line.

Test the contract by calling:

* `supply()` — to check the remaining supply of tokens on the contract.
* `check()` — to check the amount of tokens owned by the Ethereum address you are using to call the contract.
* `pricePerEth()` — to check the token price in wei.

### Interact with the contract

1. In MetaMask, send an amount of Sepolia ether to the contract address.
2. In Cockpit, call the contract functions `supply()` and `check()` after a few seconds to see a change in values returned.
