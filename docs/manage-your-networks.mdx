 1. Select a public chain project and click **Get started** or **Join network**. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](/docs/manage-your-project#create-a-project).
 2. Select a network and a node you want to deploy.

 ## View network status

 You can view the node and network status in the **Status** column of your nodes list or your networks list. A network can be in one of the following states:

 | Network status | Description                                 |
 | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
 | Running        | The node is running and everything is okay. |
 | Failed         | The node is `Failed` or in `Error`.         |

 ## Delete a network

 <Warning>
   To be able to delete a network, you must first delete all nodes associated with the network. See [Delete a node](/docs/manage-your-node#delete-a-node).
 </Warning>

 To delete a network:
 1. Click your project.
2. Click a network in the project.
3. Click **Edit** > **Delete**.
