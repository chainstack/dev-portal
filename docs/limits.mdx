  * Growth plan: 50 requests per second (RPS)

* Solana Devnet:

  * Developer plan: 25 requests per second (RPS)
  * Growth plan: 250 requests per second (RPS)

### Arbitrum-specific

* Arbitrum Mainnet: `debug_traceBlockByNumber` 20 RPS on all plans

### All other protocols

* Developer plan: 25 requests per second (RPS)
* Growth plan: 250 requests per second (RPS)
* Pro plan: 400 requests per second (RPS)
* Business: 600 requests per second (RPS)
* Enterprise: unlimited

To upgrade a subscription plan, do the following:

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Billing**.
2. Next to **Plan**, click **Change**.
3. Select a new subscription plan and click **Next**.
4. Check the details of your new subscription plan and click **Confirm**.

Your subscription plan changes immediately.

  ### Dedicated nodes

  You can also order [dedicated nodes](/docs/dedicated-node) and pay for the node resource consumption only instead of per-request billing.

## EVM Range limits

For `eth_newFilter` requests, Developer subscription plan users get capped at 10,000 blocks per request.

For the `eth_getLogs`, the caps are:

* Developer plan — 100 blocks
* Growth plan — 10,000 blocks
* Pro plan — 10,000 blocks
* Business plan — 10,000 blocks
* Enterprise — 10,000 blocks. Customization available on request.

<Info>
  Learn more about `eth_getLogs` limits by reading [Understanding eth\_getLogs limitations](/docs/understanding-eth-getlogs-limitations).
</Info>

For users on the Developer subscription plan, Chainstack applies a specific range limit for certain requests.

This limit is designed to optimize the performance and resource allocation for our users on this plan.

## Custom tracers on EVMs

Custom JavaScript tracers are available as customized solutions on the [Enterprise plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) on [dedicated nodes](/docs/dedicated-node).

## Ethereum `eth_simulateV1` supports only full node

Running [eth\_simulateV1 | Ethereum](/reference/ethereum_node_api/execute_transactions/eth_simulateV1) will yield only a full node response—i.e. the data from the latest 128 blocks. Archive data is not supported for this call and the node will respond with `missing trie node`.

* `getSignaturesForAddress`
* `getTransaction`
* `getBlock`
* `getBlocks`
* `getBlockHeight`
* `getBlockTime`
* `getBlocksgetBlocksWithLimit`
