## Rate limits

### Solana-specific

* Solana Mainnet:

  * Developer plan: 5 requests per second (RPS)
  * Growth plan: 50 requests per second (RPS)

* Solana Devnet:

  * Developer plan: 25 requests per second (RPS)
  * Growth plan: 250 requests per second (RPS)

### Arbitrum-specific

* Arbitrum Mainnet: `debug_traceBlockByNumber` 20 RPS on all plans

### All other protocols

For global plan RPS limits across all other protocols, see [Requests per second (RPS) plan limits](/docs/rps-plan-limits).

## EVM Range limits

For `eth_newFilter` requests, Developer subscription plan users get capped at 10,000 blocks per request.

For the `eth_getLogs`, the caps are:

* Developer plan — 100 blocks
* Growth plan — 10,000 blocks
* Pro plan — 10,000 blocks
* Business plan — 10,000 blocks
* Enterprise — 10,000 blocks. Customization available on request.

<Info>
  Learn more about `eth_getLogs` limits by reading [Understanding eth\_getLogs limitations](/docs/understanding-eth-getlogs-limitations).
</Info>

For users on the Developer subscription plan, Chainstack applies a specific range limit for certain requests.

This limit is designed to optimize the performance and resource allocation for our users on this plan.

## Custom tracers on EVMs

Custom JavaScript tracers are available as customized solutions on the [Enterprise plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) on [dedicated nodes](/docs/dedicated-node).

## Ethereum `eth_simulateV1` supports only full node

Running [eth\_simulateV1 | Ethereum](/reference/ethereum-simulatev1) will yield only a full node response—i.e. the data from the latest 128 blocks. Archive data is not supported for this call and the node will respond with `missing trie node`.

## Fantom method limits

The following limits are applied on all subscription plans:

* `debug_traceBlockByNumber`: 5 RPS
* `debug_traceBlockByHash`: 5 RPS

## Solana method limits

The following limits are applied:

* `getBlocks`: 500,000 blocks range. This is the [Solana architecture limit](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/http/getblocks).

* `getBlocksWithLimit`: 500,000 blocks range. This is the [Solana architecture limit](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/http/getblockswithlimit).

* `getBlock`:

  * Chainstack Global Network Worldwide `global1` RPS: 100
  * Chainstack Cloud London `lon1` RPS: 100
  * Chainstack Cloud New York City `nyc1` RPS: 100

* `getBlockTime`:

  * Chainstack Global Network Worldwide `global1` RPS: 100
  * Chainstack Cloud London `lon1` RPS: 100
  * Chainstack Cloud New York City `nyc1` RPS: 100

* `getProgramAccounts`:

  * Chainstack Global Network `global1` RPS: 3
  * Chainstack Cloud London `lon1` RPS: 10
  * Chainstack Cloud New York City `nyc1` RPS: 3

* `getConfirmedBlock`:

  * Chainstack Global Network `global1` RPS: 30
  * Chainstack Cloud London `lon1` RPS: 30
  * Chainstack Cloud New York City `nyc1` RPS: 30

* `getSupply`:

  * Chainstack Global Network Worldwide `global1` RPS: 2
  * Chainstack Cloud London `lon1` RPS: 2
  * Chainstack Cloud New York City `nyc1` RPS: 2

* `getTokenAccountsByOwner`:

  * Chainstack Global Network Worldwide `global1` RPS: 100
  * Chainstack Cloud London `lon1` RPS: 100
  * Chainstack Cloud New York City `nyc1` RPS: 100

* `getTokenSupply`:

  * Chainstack Global Network Worldwide `global1` RPS: 80
  * Chainstack Cloud London `lon1` RPS: 80
  * Chainstack Cloud New York City `nyc1` RPS: 80

## Solana accounts excluded from indexing

The following Solana accounts are unavailable for querying:

* `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA`
* `kinXdEcpDQeHPEuQnqmUgtYykqKGVFq6CeVX5iAHJq6`

## Solana method availability

The following methods are available only on the paid plans:

* `getProgramAccounts`
* `getLargestAccounts` — this method is available only on [Dedicated Nodes](/docs/dedicated-node).
* `getSupply`
* `getTokenAccountsByOwner`

## Solana archive methods availability

While most methods are supported on Solana [Global Nodes](/docs/global-elastic-node), only the following methods can fetch archive data:

* `getSignaturesForAddress`
* `getTransaction`
* `getBlock`
* `getBlocks`
* `getBlockHeight`
* `getBlockTime`
* `getBlocksWithLimit`

Note that this is only true for mainnet as there are no Solana archive nodes for Devnet.
