## What is a dedicated node?

A dedicated node is a node that exclusively deployed for and belongs to a particular customer, with its compute resources are not being shared with anybody else. Such nodes are highly customizable and can offer more additional services than other node types. This means that each dedicated node can be configured to perfectly match the case and needs of a particular customer.
