## Modes

For Trader Nodes deployed on the most of public chains, Chainstack supports the following modes:

* Full — a node that stores full blockchain data. However, it has limitations to how many blocks are available for querying.
* Archive — a node that stores full blockchain data and an archive of historical states, which makes it possible to query any block since the chain genesis.
  * Warp transactions — nodes dedicated to propagating and landing transaction at the fastest speed possible. See [Warp transactions](/docs/warp-transactions).

## Dedicated gateways

A dedicated gateway is one of the Trader Node customization features that is available on the [Enterprise plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing/).

Dedicated gateways process connections and traffic exclusively for a specific customer, avoiding potential issues from handling multiple customers' workload. This ensures a stable and reliable connection while reducing the likelihood of connection errors.
