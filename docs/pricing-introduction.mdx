## Pricing principles

Each Chainstack’s subscription plan has its own quota that represents the allocated resources and usage limits that users can spend within their chosen plan. In addition to the allocated quota, Chainstack also offers the convenience of "pay-as-you-go" billing for any extra usage beyond the specified limits. This means that if users exceed their allocated quota, they can continue using Chainstack's services seamlessly, with any additional usage being automatically charged at the applicable rates. Visit Chainstack’s [pricing page](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) to get familiar with a quota for each plan and extra usage costs.

Quota spending can vary depending on the combination of services that you use. Service cost is reflected in [request units](/docs/pricing-introduction#what-are-request-units).

In addition to basic services, you can purchase Chainstack’s add-ons that help you to enrich your experience with the platform and improve your DApp performance. Available add-ons and their cost can be found in the [pricing page](https://chainstack.com/pricing/).

* Warp transactions — due to the partnership with bloXroute, Warp transactions are charged separately.
* Compute hours and hourly rated storage — for dedicated nodes and indexers.
* Management fee — for hybrid hosting. [Contact us](https://chainstack.com/contact/) to learn more.

## What are request units?

Request unit (RU) is a metric that measures the size and complexity of request processing for Chainstack request-based services.

## Why request units are used for pricing?

In the Web3 ecosystem, certain requests can require more extensive data processing or involve complex computations and higher spending of resources. Such requests will cost more RU. This ensures that the pricing is more closely aligned with the actual resource consumption and effort required for each request.

The introduction of request units allows us to offer a fairer and more flexible pricing structure, taking into account the diverse nature of blockchain infrastructure operations.

  ### TON requests

  For TON, there's no difference between a full node an archive node in data availability or pricing. All data is always available and all node requests are consumed as 1 request unit.

## Payment mechanics

Your internal balance serves as a primary payment source to cover any charges incurred from using the Chainstack services. If your balance has sufficient funds, the charges are automatically deducted from it. If the balance is insufficient, Chainstack then proceeds to charge the attached credit card.

Currently, the following payment methods can be used to top up your balance:

* Credit card
* Crypto payment from Chainstack console (powered by Coinbase Commerce)
* Wire transfer
* Direct crypto payment

If your request volume is extra high or you prefer specific payment methods, [contact us](https://chainstack.com/contact/) for a special offer.
