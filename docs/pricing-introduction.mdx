## Pricing principles

Each Chainstack’s subscription plan has its own quota that represents the allocated resources and usage limits that users can spend within their chosen plan. In addition to the allocated quota, Chainstack also offers the convenience of "pay-as-you-go" billing for any extra usage beyond the specified limits. This means that if users exceed their allocated quota, they can continue using Chainstack's services seamlessly, with any additional usage being automatically charged at the applicable rates. Visit Chainstack’s [pricing page](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) to get familiar with a quota for each plan and extra usage costs.

Quota spending can vary depending on the combination of services that you use. Service cost is reflected in [request units](/docs/request-units#what-are-request-units).

In addition to basic services, you can purchase Chainstack’s add-ons that help you to enrich your experience with the platform and improve your DApp performance. Available add-ons and their cost can be found in the [pricing page](https://chainstack.com/pricing/).

## Payment mechanics

Your internal balance serves as a primary payment source to cover any charges incurred from using the Chainstack services. If your balance has sufficient funds, the charges are automatically deducted from it. If the balance is insufficient, Chainstack then proceeds to charge the attached credit card.

Currently, the following payment methods can be used to top up your balance:

* Credit card
* Crypto payment from Chainstack console (powered by Coinbase Commerce)
* Wire transfer
* Direct crypto payment

If your request volume is extra high or you prefer specific payment methods, [contact us](https://chainstack.com/contact/) for a special offer.
