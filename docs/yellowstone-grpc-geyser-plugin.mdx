_Solana is fast. Geyser is faster._

Yellowstone gRPC Geyser is a high-speed, plugin-based interface that streams live Solana blockchain data directly from validator memory, eliminating the latency of traditional RPC methods.

Benefits

- Real-time streaming of transactions, account updates, blocks, and slot changes.
- Uses a standard gRPC interface with protobuf-formatted payloads.
- Accessible from any language supporting gRPC (Python, Go, Rust, JavaScript).
- Ideal for analytics, sniping bots, MEV strategies, data indexing, real-time dashboards, and compliance monitoring.
- Comprehensive data including transaction details, instructions, and logs.
