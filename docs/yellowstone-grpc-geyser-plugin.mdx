_Solana is fast. Geyser is faster._

Yellowstone gRPC Geyser is a high-speed, plugin-based interface that streams live Solana blockchain data directly from validator memory, eliminating the latency of traditional RPC methods.

  ### Geyser is available starting from Growth

  Geyser is available as a separate paid add-on starting from the [Growth plan](https://chainstack.com/pricing).

Benefits

- Real-time streaming of transactions, account updates, blocks, and slot changes.
- Uses a standard gRPC interface with protobuf-formatted payloads.
- Accessible from any language supporting gRPC (Python, Go, Rust, JavaScript).
- Ideal for analytics, sniping bots, MEV strategies, data indexing, real-time dashboards, and compliance monitoring.
- `from_slot`/`fromSlot` support to replay and recover missed events. For an example, see `learning-examples/historical_replay_with_from_slot.py` in [Solana Geyser Python tutorial](https://github.com/chainstacklabs/grpc-geyser-tutorial).

## Jito ShredStream enabled by default

Chainstack Solana nodes have Jito ShredStream enabled by default, providing significantly enhanced performance for Yellowstone gRPC Geyser streaming. ShredStream accelerates block data propagation by delivering shreds directly to nodes, resulting in better consistency, improved tail latency, and higher reliability. No additional configuration is required.

## Enable the Yellowstone gRPC Geyser plugin

1. Deploy a Solana [Global Node](/docs/global-elastic-node)

2. Click on your deployed Solana node.

3. Click **Add-ons** > **Yellowstone gRPC Geyser Plugin** > **Install**.

## Limits

$49/month:
* Unlimited stream events
* 1 concurrent stream available per platform account
* Up to 50 Solana accounts per stream

$149/month:
* Unlimited stream events
* 5 concurrent streams available per platform account
* Up to 50 Solana accounts per stream

$449/month:
* Unlimited stream events
* 25 concurrent streams available per platform account
* Up to 50 Solana accounts per stream

Regardless of the plan: 5 concurrent filters of the same type in a single connection for all types:
* `accounts`
* `slots`
* `transactions`
* `transactions_status`
* `blocks`
* `blocks_meta`
* `entries`

Note that on a dedicated Solana node with Yellowstone gRPC Geyser plugin limit customization is available.

The following Solana accounts are unavailable for streaming:

* `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA`
* `kinXdEcpDQeHPEuQnqmUgtYykqKGVFq6CeVX5iAHJq6`
