title: "Chainstack DLP tool overview"
description: "In the digital age, data privacy, and security have become paramount. As we increasingly rely on artificial intelligence (AI) models for various tasks, we must ensure that our interactions with these models do not inadvertently expose sensitive information. This is particularly relevant when using AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT, where users often input data that could be personal or sensitive."

The Chainstack DLP browser extension is designed to enhance the privacy and security of your interactions with ChatGPT. This extension works by redacting potentially sensitive information before it's sent to ChatGPT for processing, including names, addresses, API keys, JWTs, etc.

<Info>
  Currently, **Chainstack DLP** is available either locally from the source code or through installation on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chainstack-dlp/miihnlobablmmphiogghcpeebijgpgce?hl=en\&authuser=0).

## Processing sensitive data

To function as a genuine data loss prevention (DLP) tool, Chainstack DLP performs all processing locally. This means the extension does not rely on any external APIs, ensuring that your data never leaves your local environment. Trust is a critical factor in data security, and to uphold this trust, we've made our tool 100% open-source. This transparency allows you to verify the security measures we've implemented. You can install the extension directly from the store, or, for those who prefer, you can also install it locally using this repository.

Chainstack DLP tool employs regular expression patterns to detect potentially sensitive data, such as API keys, credit card numbers, JWTs, etc. Additionally, it utilizes the [compromise package](https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise) V 14.9.0, a robust JavaScript library for natural language processing (NLP). This library aids in the identification of personal and business identifiers, including names, addresses, and company names.

## Source code

The source code of the Chainstack DLP tool is 100% open source and is available on the Chainstack Labs GitHub account.

## Usage

The Chainstack DLP introduces two buttons and a small preview window above the ChatGPT input bar. The `â†•` button serves two functions: expanding and minimizing the preview window. Meanwhile, the clear button deletes all content within the ChatGPT input bar.

A popup window is provided to manage the redaction tool. Users can enable or disable the tool and select or unselect specific types of data to redact. However, particularly sensitive data such as credit card patterns, JSON Web Tokens, Ethereum private keys, and phone numbers cannot be disabled.

Any changes made within the popup window will update live. However, you must empty the ChatGPT input bar and reenter the content to see these changes. A preview is available to check the content before submitting it to ChatGPT. If something appears malfunctioning, reloading the page should resolve the issue.
