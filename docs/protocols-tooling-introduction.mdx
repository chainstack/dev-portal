title: "Introduction"
description: "Tooling is a collection of guides that provide an extensive overview of various tools and methods that can be utilized to interact with different blockchain networks. It encompasses a broad range of tools, from command-line interfaces specific to each protocol to programming libraries such as web3.js, web3.py, and web3.php. Most of the protocols also have instructions for using popular blockchain development frameworks like Truffle, Hardhat, and Remix IDE."

Each protocol's guide is designed to offer step-by-step instructions for each tool, including installation, configuration, and usage examples, such as how to get the balance of an address, query data using GraphQL, or deploy smart contracts using Truffle or Hardhat. It also provides details on how to connect to blockchain nodes using different protocols and endpoints, and how to secure these connections using keys or passwords.
