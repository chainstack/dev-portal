title: "Solana: Understanding Block Time"
---

**TLDR:**
* Solana’s slot-based timeline can be confusing—remember slots are scheduled intervals (\~400ms), while blocks only exist if produced in those intervals.
* Timestamps on Solana are derived from validator-submitted UTC times, with built-in drift rules (25% fast, 150% slow) to maintain accurate on-chain time.
* For critical time logic, rely on the on-chain `Clock` sysvar (`unix_timestamp`) rather than local or client clocks.
* Don’t confuse slots (intervals) with block heights (successful block productions), and keep drift and missed slots in mind when designing dApps.

## Main article

If you are coming from EVM, or pretty much any other blockchain, you have to realize that Solana's **block time** is actually an integral part of the consensus and thus differs notably from everything else.

## Key concepts

* **Slots** — scheduled intervals (\~400ms each) designated for validators to attempt block production. Due to network conditions, not all slots produce blocks. Which creates even more confusion. See [Solana: Understanding the difference between blocks and slots](/docs/understanding-the-difference-between-blocks-and-slots-on-solana).
* **Blocks** — actual data structures containing transactions, state changes, and related metadata. Blocks only exist if validators successfully produce them.
* **Timestamps** — Solana derives block timestamps via consensus rather than including explicit timestamps in block headers. Validators periodically submit their UTC timestamps; the network calculates a stake-weighted mean to set each block’s timestamp.
* **Drift and accuracy** — Solana caps timestamp drift (up to 25% forward and 150% backward — see further in the article for an example) from the expected progression to safeguard against manipulation or malicious validators.

## Validator impact

Validators use Proof of History (PoH) internally for timing. They vote on blocks, including UTC timestamps. Missed or skipped slots result in gaps without blocks or timestamps, creating a divergence between the slot and block counts.

## Off-chain time retrieval via JSON-RPC

### Get block time

Retrieve estimated Unix timestamp for a given slot:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getBlockTime","params":[SLOT_NUMBER]}' \
    CHAINSTACK_SOLANA_URL
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Replace `SLOT_NUMBER` with the desired slot and `CHAINSTACK_SOLANA_URL` with your Solana node endpoint.

### Get detailed block information

Retrieve block details including block time and hash:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getBlock","params":[SLOT_NUMBER, {"encoding":"json"}]}' \
    CHAINSTACK_SOLANA_URL
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Replace `SLOT_NUMBER` and `CHAINSTACK_SOLANA_URL` with your Solana node endpoint.

### Get latest slot

Check the latest slot number:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getSlot"}' \
    CHAINSTACK_SOLANA_URL
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Get latest block height

Retrieve the latest block height (actual blocks produced):

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getBlockHeight"}' \
    CHAINSTACK_SOLANA_URL
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## On-chain time: `Clock` sysvar

Solana smart contracts access current time via the `Clock` sysvar:

* `unix_timestamp` — consensus-agreed timestamp of the current slot, updated every slot.

Contracts rely on this timestamp for logic like auctions or expirations.

## Time stamp drift example check

A practical example using the real timestamp.

Tmestamp drift is the allowable deviation in block timestamps from the expected time, ensuring that validators maintain a synchronized blockchain clock despite network variability.

Solana enforces asymmetric drift limits:

* [a 25% fast drift](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/blob/a99bbba064268ff89842c3ebd2b1b36d2e7c0384/runtime/src/stake_weighted_timestamp.rs#L17) — the time difference between slots can be up to 25% less than the expected 0.4 seconds, allowing a minimum of 0.3 seconds per slot instead of 0.4 seconds
* [a 150% slow drift](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/blob/a99bbba064268ff89842c3ebd2b1b36d2e7c0384/runtime/src/stake_weighted_timestamp.rs#L18) — the time difference between slots can be up to 150% more than the expected 0.4 seconds, allowing a maximum of 1.0 second per slot instead of 0.4 seconds

Let's take [Epoch 763](https://solscan.io/epoch/763) as an example to illustrate how timestamp drift can be calculated and enforced.

Epoch details:

* Epoch — [763]()
* First slot — [329616000](https://solscan.io/block/329616000)
* First block timestamp — `1743118653` (Unix timestamp for Thursday, March 27, 2025, 23:37:33 UTC)
* Current slot — [329849011](https://solscan.io/block/329849011)
* Actual timestamp for Slot [329849011](https://solscan.io/block/329849011) — `1743211690` (Saturday, March 29, 2025, 01:28:10 UTC)

Let's figure out if this actual timestamp is okay under Solana’s rules.

Step 1: how many slots passed?

* Slots passed = Current slot - Starting slot
* 329849011 - 329616000 = 233011 slots

Step 2: how much time should have passed?

* Each slot takes 0.4 seconds.
* Total expected time = 233011 × 0.4 = 93204 seconds (rounding for simplicity).

Step 3: What’s the expected timestamp?

* Expected timestamp = Starting timestamp + Expected time
* `1743118653 + 93204 = 1743211857`

So, if everything was perfect, the timestamp at slot `329849011` should be around `1743211857` (remember we also rounded up).

Step 4: what’s the allowed ange? The timestamp can drift:

* 25% fast drift — it can be 25% earlier (faster).
* 150% slow drift — it can be 150% later (slower).

Let’s calculate these limits:

* Expected time = 93204 seconds
* Fast drift — 25% of 93204 = 0.25 × 93204 = 23301 seconds earlier
* Slow drift — 150% of 93204 = 1.5 × 93204 = 139806 seconds later

So:

* Earliest allowed timestamp: 1743211857 - 23301 = 1743188556
* Latest allowed timestamp: 1743211857 + 139806 = 1743351664

The timestamp must be between **1743188556** and **1743351664**.

Step 5: is the actual timestamp okay?

* Actual timestamp = **1743211690**
* Check: Is 1743211690 between 1743188556 and 1743351664? **Yes**. It’s fine.

This mechanism allows for normal variations in clock synchronization while preventing extreme outliers from disrupting consensus timing.

## Best practices for time-sensitive logic

* **Use on-chain time** — always utilize the on-chain timestamp (`Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp`) for critical on-chain logic. Do not depend on client-side or local times.
* **Anticipate delays** — understand that Solana timestamps can slightly lag during network congestion or validator outages. Include buffer times in applications where precision is crucial.
* **Blocks vs. slots** — remember that transaction expiration is based on blocks (typically 150 blocks), not slots. Missed slots don’t affect the block-based expiry window.

## Common pitfalls

* **Misinterpreting slots and blocks** — Slots represent intervals; blocks represent successful data production. The difference can span millions. Again, see [Solana: Understanding the difference between blocks and slots](/docs/understanding-the-difference-between-blocks-and-slots-on-solana).
* **Incorrect expiry calculations** — Ensure calculations use block counts (150 blocks) for transactions validity, not slot counts. Same reference here [Solana: Understanding the difference between blocks and slots](/docs/understanding-the-difference-between-blocks-and-slots-on-solana).
* **RPC method confusion** — be aware that `getBlock` takes a slot number but returns block-specific information, including block height. Again, [Solana: Understanding the difference between blocks and slots](/docs/understanding-the-difference-between-blocks-and-slots-on-solana).

Understanding these nuances of Solana’s block and slot dynamics ensures effective development, precise transaction management, and robust dApp functionality.

And don't forget to code your `getBlock` calls efficiently — see [Solana: optimize your getBlock performance](/docs/solana-optimize-your-getblock-performance).
