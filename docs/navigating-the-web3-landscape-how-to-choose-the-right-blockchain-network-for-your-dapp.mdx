title: "Navigating the Web3 landscape: How to choose the right blockchain network for your dApp"
---

**TLDR:**
* Blockchain solutions fall into two main categories, layer 1 (L1) and layer 2 (L2), each balancing scalability, decentralization, and security differently.
* Layer 1 networks like Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Bitcoin are foundational and often the go-to for robust smart contract functionality or simple store-of-value use cases.
* Layer 2 solutions (e.g., Polygon, zkSync Era, Arbitrum) offload transactions from mainnets, resulting in faster throughput and lower costs, while still benefiting from the security of L1.
* Chainstack supports a broad range of L1 and L2 networks, so you can pick the one that best matches your DApp’s performance, security, and cost requirements.

## Main article

Blockchain technology has transformed various industries, offering transparency, security, and decentralization. Selecting the right blockchain network can significantly impact the performance, security, and user experience of your DApp. With many networks available, this article will guide you in making an informed decision. Chainstack supports many networks, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, BNB Smart Chain, and many more.

## Layer 1 vs layer 2: A brief overview

Blockchain solutions come in various flavors, each with unique features tailored for specific use cases. The two primary categories within the blockchain ecosystem are layer 1 (L1) and layer 2 (L2) blockchains. While L1 networks offer robust security and decentralization, L2 solutions might be more suitable for applications requiring high transaction speeds and lower fees.

### Layer 1 network

Layer 1 networks form the foundation of the blockchain ecosystem, serving as the base layer for DApps and cryptocurrencies. Their key characteristics include:

* Decentralization — highly decentralized with a distributed network of nodes. Examples: Bitcoin and Ethereum.
* Security — robust consensus mechanisms like PoW or PoS ensure security.
* Scalability — some L1 networks face scalability challenges, leading to congestion and high fees.
* Smart contracts — support for decentralized applications with programmable logic.
* Native tokens — used as gas fees or as a store of value.

### Layer 2 network

Layer 2 networks address the scalability and cost issues of layer 1 networks, operating atop L1 networks and leveraging their security. L2 networks' key characteristics include:

* Scalability solutions — designed to offload transactions from L1, increasing throughput and reducing congestion.
* Cost efficiency — offer cost-effective alternatives for microtransactions.
* Interoperability — can connect different L1 networks or bridge to traditional financial systems.
* Security — benefit from the security of L1 but may have unique security considerations.
* Use cases — ideal for high transaction throughput applications like gaming and DeFi.
