title: "Ethereum: Academic Certificates with Truffle"
---

**TLDR:**

* You’ll build and deploy a contract-based DApp that generates and verifies academic certificates on Ethereum.
* You’ll use Truffle locally to create, test, and compile your contracts.
* You’ll integrate with Chainstack to run your own Ethereum Sepolia node and migrate your contracts.
* By the end, you’ll have a fully working certificate-issuing DApp ready for a testnet deployment.

## Main article

In this tutorial, you will:

* Create a DApp that generates an academic certificate.
* Deploy the DApp on a public Ethereum node using Chainstack.

The contract and the Truffle configuration are in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chainstack/ethereum-certificates-tutorial).

## Prerequisites

* [Chainstack account](https://console.chainstack.com/user/login) to deploy an Ethereum node
* [Truffle Suite](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/how-to/install/) to create and deploy contracts

## Step-by-step

### Create a public chain project

See [Create a project](/docs/manage-your-project#create-a-project).

### Join the Ethereum Sepolia testnet

See [Join a public network](/docs/manage-your-networks#join-a-public-network).

### Get your Ethereum node access and credentials

See [View node access and credentials](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).

### Get Sepolia testnet ether from a faucet

In your MetaMask, fund each account with Sepolia ether from our [Sepolia Ethereum faucet](https://faucet.chainstack.com).

### Create and compile the contracts

<Steps>
  <Step>
    On your machine, create a directory for the contract. Initialize Truffle in the directory:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```shell Shell
     truffle init
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   This will generate the Truffle boilerplate structure:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```shell Shell
     .
     ├── contracts
     │   └── .gitkeep
     ├── migrations
     │   └── .gitkeep
     ├── test
     │   └── .gitkeep
     └── truffle-config.js
     ```
   </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Go to the `contracts` directory. In the directory, create two files: `Ownable.sol` and `DocStamp.sol`.

   <CodeGroup>
     ```sol Ownable.sol
     //SPDX-License-Identifier:MIT
     // Ownable.sol

     pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

     contract Ownable {
       address public owner;
       event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);

       constructor() public {
         owner = msg.sender;
       }

       modifier onlyOwner() {
         require(msg.sender == owner);
         _;
       }

       function transferOwnership(address newOwner) onlyOwner public {
         require(newOwner != address(0));
         emit OwnershipTransferred(owner, newOwner);
         owner = newOwner;
       }
     }
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   This is an ownable contract. The contract implementation is the following:

   * Only an authority can generate a certificate. On contract deployment, the authority is the account that deploys the contract. The authority is the contract owner.

   * The contract owner can transfer their authority.

     <CodeGroup>
       ```sol DocStamp.sol
       //SPDX-License-Identifier:MIT
       // DocStamp.sol

       pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

       import './Ownable.sol';

       contract DocStamp is Ownable {
         mapping (bytes32 => address) public records;

         event CertificateIssued(bytes32 indexed record, uint256 timestamp, bool returnValue);

         function issueCertificate(string calldata name, string calldata details) external onlyOwner {
           bytes32 certificate = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(name, details));
           require(certificate != keccak256(abi.encodePacked("")));
           records[certificate] = msg.sender;
           emit CertificateIssued(certificate, block.timestamp, true);
         }

         function owningAuthority() external view returns (address) {
           return owner;
         }

         function verifyCertificate(string calldata name, string calldata details, bytes32 certificate) external view
          returns (bool) {
           bytes32 certificate2 = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(name, details));
           // are certificates the same?
           if (certificate == certificate2) {
             // does the certificate exist on the blockchain?
             if (records[certificate] == owner) {
               return true;
             }
           }
           return false;
         }
       }
       ```
     </CodeGroup>

   This is the main contract. The contract handles the generation and verification of certificates.

   * `issueCertificate()` — generates a certificate by calculating a hash of the student name and details.

     * Can be called only by the owner.
     * Emits a certificate generation event with the timestamp.
     * The issuer puts the certificate on the blockchain by storing it in the global variable records by passing `records[certificate] = msg.sender`.

   * `owningAuthority()` — returns the address of issuer/authority.

   * `verifyCertificate()` — calculates a hash of the student name and details, and checks if the contract is on the blockchain.
     * Can be called by anyone.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Create `2_deploy_contracts.js` in the `migrations` directory.

   <CodeGroup>
     ```javascript Javascript
     var DocStamp = artifacts.require("./DocStamp.sol");

     module.exports = function(deployer) {
     deployer.deploy(DocStamp);
     };
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   <Info>
    ### Deployment details

     Since DocStamp inherits from Ownable, Ownable will be deployed together with DocStamp.
   </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Compile the contracts:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```shell Shell
     truffle compile
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   This will compile the contracts and put them in your `build/contracts` directory in the `.json` format. If the contract does not compile, check the compiler version in your `truffle-config.js` file and ensure that your compiler version matches the pragma solidity version of the contract.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Deploy the contract to your local development network

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Start the development network on your machine:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```shell Shell
     truffle develop
     ```
   </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Without exiting the Truffle console, deploy the contract to the local development network:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```shell Shell
     truffle(develop)>  migrate
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   This will deploy the contract to the development network as specified in the`truffle-config.js`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Interact with the contract on your local development network

<Steps>
  <Step>
    In your Truffle console, create an instance of the deployed contract:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```javascript Javascript
     let instance = await DocStamp.deployed()
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   You can run `instance` to see the contract object ABI, bytecode, and methods.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Declare the contract owner:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```javascript Javascript
     let owner = await instance.owningAuthority()
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   You can run `owner` to see the account that deployed the contract and owns the contract.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Issue the certificate:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```javascript Javascript
     let result = await instance.issueCertificate("John", "graduate", {from: owner})
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   This issues the certificate.

   Run `result.logs` to view the full certificate details.

   <Info>
    ### Getting certificate details

     Running result will not print the certificate details in Truffle console. You must run `result.logs`.

     See also [Processing transaction results](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/interacting-with-your-contracts#processing-transaction-results).
   </Info>

   Example output:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```shell Shell
     logIndex: 0,
       transactionIndex: 0,
       transactionHash: '0xb3ef241d76bd4d3a3d92ad4fd382785589033a4f561baa2895136a3315b3561b',
       blockHash: '0x29343b9fc5b88bb8c85287463a37a00e8fecce36553880365ca5395d9fb18eeb',
       blockNumber: 7,
       address: '0x3113Aa54D455142a254b43b83FB16c18eD30ba33',
       type: 'mined',
       id: 'log_dbbbec7e',
       event: 'CertificateIssued',
       args: Result {
         '0': '0x837e31a66aa8eec0d7adfd41f84175803ddcae69afd451598f2672f652b2c153',
         '1': [BN],
         '2': true,
         __length__: 3,
         record: '0x837e31a66aa8eec0d7adfd41f84175803ddcae69afd451598f2672f652b2c153',
         timestamp: [BN],
         returnValue: true
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   Note the `record` value in the output. This is the hash of the certificate values: name and details. You will need this hash to create the contract test later in this tutorial.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Run the certificate verification:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```javascript Javascript
     let verify = await instance.verifyCertificate("NAME", "DETAILS", "CERTIFICATE_HASH", {from: owner})
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   where

   * NAME — the student name on the certificate used on the issuing step.
   * DETAILS — any details
   * CERTIFICATE\_HASH — the hash of DETAILS and NAME. You should have received this hash in the record field at the previous step by running `result.logs`.

   Example:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```javascript Javascript
     let verified = await instance.verifyCertificate("John", "graduate",
     "0x837e31a66aa8eec0d7adfd41f84175803ddcae69afd451598f2672f652b2c153", {from: owner})
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   Running `verify` will now print `true` if there is a match, and `false` if there is no match.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Test the contract

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Navigate to the `test` directory.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Create a `test.js` file:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```javascript Javascript
     const DocStamp = artifacts.require('./DocStamp.sol')

     contract('DocStamp', function(accounts) {
       it('should issue a certificate', async function() {
         const account = accounts[0]

         try {
           const instance = await DocStamp.deployed()
           await instance.issueCertificate("NAME", "DETAILS")
           const authority = await instance.owningAuthority()

           assert.equal(authority, account)
         } catch(error) {
           assert.equal(error, undefined)
         }
       })

       it('should verify a certificate', async function() {
         const account = accounts[0]

         try {
           const instance = await DocStamp.deployed()
           const verified = await instance.verifyCertificate("NAME", "DETAILS", "CERTIFICATE_HASH")

           assert.equal(verified, true)
         } catch(error) {
           assert.equal(error, undefined)
         }
       })
     })
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   where

   * NAME — the student name on the certificate used on the issuing step.
   * DETAILS — any details
   * CERTIFICATE\_HASH — the hash of DETAILS and NAME. You should have received this hash in the record field at one of the previous steps by running `result.logs`.

   Example:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```javascript Javascript
     const DocStamp = artifacts.require('./DocStamp.sol')

     contract('DocStamp', function(accounts) {
       it('should issue a certificate', async function() {
         const account = accounts[0]

         try {
           const instance = await DocStamp.deployed()
           await instance.issueCertificate("John", "graduate")
           const authority = await instance.owningAuthority()

           assert.equal(authority, account)
         } catch(error) {
           assert.equal(error, undefined)
         }
       })

       it('should verify a certificate', async function() {
         const account = accounts[0]

         try {
           const instance = await DocStamp.deployed()
           const verified = await instance.verifyCertificate("John", "graduate",
     "0x837e31a66aa8eec0d7adfd41f84175803ddcae69afd451598f2672f652b2c153")

           assert.equal(verified, true)
         } catch(error) {
           assert.equal(error, undefined)
         }
       })
     })
     ```
   </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Run the test:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```shell Shell
     truffle test
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   The test run output should be `Passing`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Info>

### Deploy the contract to your Ethereum node

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Install `HDWalletProvider`.

    [HDWalletProvider](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/packages/hdwallet-provider) is Truffle's separate npm package used to sign transactions.

   Run:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```shell Shell
     npm install @truffle/hdwallet-provider
     ```
   </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Edit `truffle-config.js` to add:

   * HDWalletProvider

   * Your Ethereum node access and credentials. Example:

     <CodeGroup>
       ```javascript Javascript
       const HDWalletProvider = require("@truffle/hdwallet-provider");
       const mnemonic = "misery walnut expose ...";

       module.exports = {
        networks: {
           development: {
               host: "127.0.0.1",
               port: 9545,
               network_id: "5777"
           },
           sepolia: {
               provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT"),
               network_id: 11155111,
               gas: 4500000,
               gasPrice: 10000000000
           }
          }
       };
       ```
     </CodeGroup>

   where

   * `sepolia` — any network name that you will pass to the `truffle migrate --network` command.
   * `HDWalletProvider` — Truffle's custom provider to sign transactions
   * `mnemonic` — your mnemonic that generates your accounts. You can also generate a mnemonic online with [Mnemonic Code Converter](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/). Make sure you generate a 15-word mnemonic.
   * YOUR\_CHAINSTACK\_ENDPOINT — your Chainstack node endpoint. See [View node access and credentials](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials) and [Ethereum tooling](/docs/ethereum-tooling).
   * `network_id` — the Ethereum Sepolia testnet network ID: `5`.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Run:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```shell Shell
     truffle migrate --network sepolia
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   This will engage `2_deploy_contracts.js` and deploy the contract to the Ethereum Sepolia testnet as specified in `truffle-config.js`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
### Get testnet ether

  You must get the Sepolia testnet ether to deploy the contract to the testnet.
</Warning>
