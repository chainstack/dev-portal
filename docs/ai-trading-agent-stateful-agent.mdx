This section introduces a memory-enabled trading agent that learns from trading history to make data-driven decisions. Unlike the stateless agent that treats each decision independently, a stateful agent analyzes past trade performance, identifies successful patterns, and adapts strategies based on historical outcomes.

## Learning capabilities

The stateful agent implements several learning mechanisms:

**Historical performance analysis**
- Tracks profit/loss for each trade type (ETH->USDC vs USDC->ETH)
- Calculates success rates and identifies most profitable strategies
- Analyzes recent performance trends to detect improving or declining performance

**Market pattern recognition**
- Identifies price levels where trades were most successful
- Correlates market volatility with trading outcomes
- Detects market conditions similar to past successful trades

**Context-aware decision making**
- Includes recent trade history in LLM prompts
- Provides performance insights: "ETH selling trades averaged +2.3% profit (5 trades)"
- Highlights similar market conditions: "Similar conditions: 3 trades, avg profit +1.8%"

**Intelligent memory management**
- Preserves key learning insights during context summarization
- Retains top-performing trades and recent trading history
- Maintains performance metrics across context resets

## Technical implementation

The stateful agent implements sophisticated technical mechanisms to manage memory, context windows, and learning persistence.

### Context window management

**Token estimation and monitoring**

The agent continuously tracks context usage through advanced token estimation:

```python
# Real-time context monitoring
prompt_token_count = self._estimate_token_count(user_query)

# Safely calculate context tokens with null check
context_token_count = 0
for decision in self.context.trading_decisions:
    if decision.reasoning:
        context_token_count += self._estimate_token_count(decision.reasoning)

# Add market state tokens
market_state_tokens = len(self.context.market_states) * 20

# Calculate total usage
total_estimated_tokens = prompt_token_count + context_token_count + market_state_tokens
context_usage_ratio = total_estimated_tokens / self.context_capacity
```

**Threshold-based summarization**

When context usage approaches the configured threshold, automatic summarization triggers:

- **Warning threshold**: 90% of context capacity (configurable via `CONTEXT_WARNING_THRESHOLD`)
- **Automatic trigger**: Summarization activates when threshold exceeded
- **Cooldown period**: 2-minute between summarizations (configurable via `SUMMARIZATION_COOLDOWN`)
- **Recursive protection**: Prevents summarization loops during processing

**Adaptive prompt management**

The agent dynamically adjusts prompt complexity based on available context space:

```python
if self.last_context_usage.get('ratio', 0) > 0.7:
    # Use simplified prompt when context is getting full
    user_query = f"Given ETH price... {historical_context}"
else:
    # Use full enhanced prompt when context allows
    user_query = f"Given ETH price... TRADING HISTORY... PERFORMANCE INSIGHTS... MARKET PATTERNS..."
```

### Configuration integration

**Model-specific context handling**

The agent automatically adapts to different model capabilities through `config.py`:

```python
# Dynamic context capacity based on selected model
AVAILABLE_MODELS = {
    'qwen-trader': {
        'model': 'trader-qwen:latest',
        'context_capacity': 32768
    },
    'fin-r1': {
        'model': 'hf.co/Mungert/Fin-R1-GGUF',
        'context_capacity': 32768
    }
}

# Agent automatically uses appropriate capacity
self.context_capacity = get_context_capacity(MODEL_KEY, test_mode)
```

**Configuration-driven behavior**

All context management parameters respect configuration settings:

- **Context warning threshold**: `CONTEXT_WARNING_THRESHOLD = 0.9` (90%)
- **Summarization cooldown**: `SUMMARIZATION_COOLDOWN = 2 * 60` (2 minutes)
- **Test mode**: Reduced context capacity for testing summarization logic
- **Model selection**: Automatic adaptation to selected model's capabilities

<Info>
  For troubleshooting, to force an actual transaction even if the LLM model advises to hold based on the market observation, you can set `REBALANCE_THRESHOLD = 0` to force a trade without asking an LLM instance.
</Info>

### Observation mode capabilities

**Data collection without trading**

The agent supports observation-only mode for market analysis and strategy development. You can start the stateful agent in observation mode for a number of cycles and then it'll switch to active trading but will act based on the collected observation data.

Collect market data for 5000 tokens before trading:

```bash
python on-chain/uniswap_v4_stateful_trading_agent.py --observe 5000
```

Observe for 30 minutes before trading

```bash
python on-chain/uniswap_v4_stateful_trading_agent.py --observe-time 30
```

Collect 50 observation cycles before trading

```bash
python on-chain/uniswap_v4_stateful_trading_agent.py --observe-cycles 50
```

### Memory optimization techniques

**Learning insight compression**

To prevent context explosion, the agent employs sophisticated compression:

```python
# Insight compression algorithm
most_valuable_insights = sorted(learning_insights, key=len, reverse=True)[:2]
for insight in most_valuable_insights:
    compact_insight = insight[:200] + "..." if len(insight) > 200 else insight
```

**Selective data retention**

During context summarization, the agent preserves only the most valuable information:

- **Learning insights**: Top 2 most valuable patterns (compressed to 200 characters)
- **Performance metrics**: Last 3 results for each trade type
- **Market states**: Most recent 2 market conditions
- **Trading decisions**: Best performing trade + most recent trade
- **Strategy information**: Current strategy parameters and timing

**Context explosion prevention**

Multiple safeguards prevent uncontrolled memory growth:

- **Compression limits**: All insights truncated to manageable sizes
- **Retention limits**: Fixed maximum items preserved per category  
- **Cooldown enforcement**: Minimum time between summarization events
- **Recursive protection**: Flags prevent summarization during summarization
- **Priority-based selection**: Keeps most valuable data, discards redundant information

**Memory efficiency monitoring**

## Core stateful components

### Memory management system

**Trading history database**

The agent maintains comprehensive trading records in memory using the `TradingDecision` on market states and trading decisions.

### Context window management

**Intelligent memory allocation**

The system optimizes memory usage based on the model's context capacity and the configured thresholds in `config.py`. The agent automatically determines optimal memory allocation using the existing configuration parameters.

**Adaptive summarization algorithm**

When approaching context limits, the agent compresses data through the `_summarize_and_restart_context()` method.

### Strategy persistence engine

**Basic strategy tracking**

The agent maintains simple strategy information in `TradingContext`.

**Strategy functionality**

The system provides basic strategy management:

- **Strategy generation** — creates initial strategy based on observation mode
- **Strategy timing** — tracks duration and elapsed time using MIN/MAX_STRATEGY_DURATION
- **Performance tracking** — separates rebalancing ROI from LLM trading ROI
- **Strategy display** — shows current strategy information in portfolio table

### Basic analytics engine

**Simple performance tracking**

The agent tracks basic performance metrics through `TradingContext` for rebalancing script PnL and LLM-driven PnL.

## Configuration and deployment

Stateful agents require careful configuration to balance memory usage, performance tracking, and strategic consistency.

## Step-by-step stateful agent deployment

Deploy your memory-enabled trading agent with proper initialization and monitoring.

### 1. Environment preparation

Ensure your base environment is ready:

Verify Ollama is running with adequate memory:

```bash
ollama serve
```

Check available system memory

On Linux:

```bash
free -h
```

On macOS:

```bash
memory_pressure
```

Confirm Foundry fork is active:

```bash
cast block-number --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
```

### 2. Stateful agent initialization

Launch the stateful trading agent with various configuration options:

**Basic trading mode:**
```bash
python on-chain/uniswap_v4_stateful_trading_agent.py
```

**Observation mode options:**
```bash
# Collect market data for 5000 tokens before trading
python on-chain/uniswap_v4_stateful_trading_agent.py --observe 5000

# Observe for 30 minutes before trading  
python on-chain/uniswap_v4_stateful_trading_agent.py --observe-time 30

# Collect 50 observation cycles before trading
python on-chain/uniswap_v4_stateful_trading_agent.py --observe-cycles 50
```

**Additional configuration options:**
```bash
# Test mode with reduced context capacity
python on-chain/uniswap_v4_stateful_trading_agent.py --test-mode

# Custom target allocation (60% ETH, 40% USDC)
python on-chain/uniswap_v4_stateful_trading_agent.py --target-allocation 0.6

# Limited number of trading iterations
python on-chain/uniswap_v4_stateful_trading_agent.py --iterations 100
```

## Next steps

With your stateful agent successfully managing memory and learning from trading history, you're ready to explore advanced model integrations for enhanced decision-making capabilities.
