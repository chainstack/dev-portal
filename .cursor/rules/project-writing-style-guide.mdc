# Chainstack Developer Portal project writing style guide

## Tone of voice

At Chainstack, we build complex tools for a primarily technical audience, displayed in a clear and intuitive way. Individuals and organizations use Chainstack as a stable foundation to support the infrastructure behind complex Web3 applications.

For these reasons, we always aim to:

1. Be clear, concise, and specific, not vague or convoluted.
2. Use correct terminology, while avoiding unnecessarily complex technical jargon.
3. Provide useful and true information.
4. Be friendly but not unprofessional.

## Style tips

Use active voice. Avoid passive voice.

In active voice, the subject of the sentence does the action. In passive voice, the subject of the sentence has the action done to it.

- Correct: Chainstack created a new network.
- Incorrect: A new network was created by Chainstack.

Use positive language rather than negative language.

- Correct: You need to delete all nodes to cancel your subscription.
- Incorrect: You can't cancel your subscription because you have active nodes on your account.

## Grammar

### Spelling

We write using American English spelling.

### Capitalization

We never use **Title case**. We use **sentence case** for everything, including titles.

**Sentence case** capitalizes the first letter of the first word, plus any proper nouns.

When writing out an email address or website URL, use all lowercase.

Example:
- [support@chainstack.com](mailto:support@chainstack.com)
- [chainstack.com](http://chainstack.com/)

We keep the proper spelling and capitalization of project names.

### Dates and time

Always use abbreviated months and days on forms, tables, lists and other condensed product elements. Non-abbreviated dates should be used in formal writing.

#### Date formats

Use abbreviated months for most contexts.

Correct:
- Jul 28, 2019
- July 2019

For formal writing, use full month names:
- July 28, 2019

#### Date ranges

Date ranges must be written using an unspaced en-dash.

Correct:
- Jul 28, 2019–Aug 29, 2019
- Monday–Friday

#### Time formats

Use 24-hour format with colons, include timezone when relevant. Use en-dash for time ranges.

Correct:
- 09:00–23:59
- 09:00–23:59 (UTC+08:00)

#### Consistency rules

Never mix abbreviated and non-abbreviated formats in the same context.

### Numbering format

We use the US-English number format.
When labeling million we use "M" instead of "MM." When labeling thousands, we use "K".

Example:
- 4,294,967,295.00
- 1,000,000 = 1M

### Pricing

Use commas (`,`) to separate thousands of pricing units. Cents are shown using periods (`.`) not commas (`,`).

The currency symbol always falls before the number. Three-letter currency codes can be denoted before the currency symbol if ambiguous.

Example:
- $99
- $9,999.99
- USD $0

### Punctuation

#### Hyphens and dashes

Use a hyphen (-) without spaces to link words into single phrase:

Example:
- first-time user, top-up amount

Use en-dash to indicate a span or range for dates, times, and other ranges.

Examples:
- Jul 23, 2023–Aug 1, 2023
- Monday–Friday
- 09:00–17:00

#### Hyphens in prefixes "re" and "pre"

Don't use a hyphen (-) after prefixes "re" and "pre" unless its absence causes confusion.

Correct:
- resend, rewrite, prehistoric
- *re-cover* and *re-creation* as distinct from *recover* and *recreation*

#### Em dash

Em dashes can function as an alternative to parentheses, commas, or a colon.

##### In sentences and paragraphs

Use an em dash *without* spaces to indicate a break in flow or set off parenthetical information.

Examples:
- It was a revival of the most potent image in modern democracy—the revolutionary idea.
- My friends—that is, my former friends—ganged up on me.
- Chainstack—a platform to manage decentralized networks and services—is actually the easiest to use.

##### In lists and technical documentation

Use an em dash *with* spaces when creating lists that explain or define terms, parameters, or concepts.

Examples:
- Ethereum — a public distributed computing platform.
- CHAINSTACK_NODE_ENDPOINT — your deployed Chainstack node.
- code-level-variable — lowercase description of the variable.

#### Periods

Periods are used in most text elements that are not **headings** or **interaction** items.

Periods go inside quotation marks. They go outside parentheses when the parenthetical is part of a larger sentence, and inside parentheses when the parenthetical stands alone.

#### Commas

We make use of the Oxford comma. In a series of 3 or more items, use a comma before the final "and" or "or".

- Correct: You need to delete all projects, networks, and nodes.
- Incorrect: You need to delete all projects, networks and nodes.

#### Exclamation marks

Use exclamation marks sparingly, and never more than one at a time. They should be almost non-existent in product elements. Do not use them in failures or alert messages.

#### Colons

When a colon is used within a sentence, the first word following the colon is lowercased unless it is a proper noun.

When a colon introduces two or more sentences, speech in dialogue, a quotation or question, the first word following it is capitalized.

To merit a colon, the words that introduce a series or list must themselves constitute a grammatically complete sentence.

Correct:
- The menagerie included cats, pigeons, newts, and deer ticks.

Incorrect:
- The menagerie included: cats, pigeons, newts, and deer ticks.

#### Semicolons

Use a semicolon between two independent clauses not joined by a conjunction to signal a closer connection between them than a period would.

### Abbreviation

Use full naming in first mention of term in text. Abbreviate later instances.

Example:
- You can deploy BNB Smart Chain (BSC) node endpoints on any Chainstack subscription plan.

Do not abbreviate Chainstack product names. Always use the full product name with proper capitalization.

## Text elements

### Navigation and menu items

Use sentence case.

Limit to one or two words.

No periods.

Example:
- Documentation
- Support
- Settings
- Sign out

### Headings

Use sentence case.

Don't write in full sentences.

No periods.

Example:
- Deploy your first blockchain node
- Edit project
- Network details

### Descriptive text, paragraphs & subheadings

Use sentence case.

Use periods.

Example:
- View your project members, and invite organizations to become project members.
- Specify basic details. Note that these cannot be changed once the network is created.

### Linking

Can be up to 5-10 words in length.

Use sentence case.

No periods if text link is on its own.

Use periods if link falls at the end of a regular sentence.

Don't link the punctuation at the end of a link.

Don't link the preceding article before the link.

Avoid one-word linking.

Use full links only for external resources.

Incorrect:
- see our [Terms of Service].
- visit the [documentation site]

Correct:
- [Contact us]
- [Review and rename nodes]
- View the [Terms of Service] and [Privacy Policy].

#### Linking the words Chainstack and Chainstack account

Correct:
- Use [Chainstack account](link) to link to console.chainstack.com
- Use [Chainstack](link) for chainstack.com

Do not mix these two.

### List items

Use sentence case and capitalize the first letter of each list item.

Keep all items in a list consistent—use either complete sentences or phrases throughout the entire list.

#### Punctuation rules for lists

Use periods when:
- List items are complete sentences

Do not use periods when:
- List items are single words, phrases, or sentence fragments

Bold text must never be the first element of a list item.

A list item may contain bold text later in the sentence (for example, to highlight a UI element), but the bullet or dash itself must start with plain text.

Exception: If the list item is a UI element name (per the UI‑elements rule), that name is allowed to appear in bold at the start of the line.

Correct:
- Listed item — listed item explanation
- Click **Members** — opens the project members page

Incorrect:
- **Listed item** — listed item explanation

#### Examples

**Complete sentences (use periods):**

To downgrade your account, you need to:

- Reduce your number of owned networks to 1.
- Reduce your number of owned nodes to 1.

**Single words or phrases (no periods):**

Chainstack supports the following protocols:

- Ethereum, Solana, BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Avalanche, TON, Ronin, Blast, ZKsync Era, Starknet, Scroll, Aptos, Fantom, Cronos, Gnosis Chain, Kaia, Moonbeam, Celo, Oasis Sapphire, Polygon zkEVM, Bitcoin, Harmony

#### Technical documentation lists with em dashes

For technical documentation lists that explain parameters, variables, or concepts, follow the em dash rules. Use em dashes with spaces and lowercase formatting:

- List item — lowercase.
- DOCS-LEVEL-VARIABLE — lowercase.
- code-level-variable — lowercase.

Example:

- Ethereum — a public distributed computing platform.
- CHAINSTACK_NODE_ENDPOINT — your deployed Chainstack node.

If the list item is not a parameter explanation, but a parameter value, use ":" instead of an em dash:

- Parameter name/explanation parameter: value

Example:

- Decoded vout: 0

## UI guidelines

### UI elements

Use **bold** to denote UI elements.

Example: To see project members, click **Members**.

### UI clickthrough

Use > to denote clicking through UI elements.

Example: To invite a member to the project, click **Members** > **Invite member**.

Note that only the UI elements are in bold, and the right angle bracket is not a UI element.

Full markdown code:
```markdown
To invite a member to the project, click **Members** > **Invite member**.
```

### UI as a word

Never use UI as a word when providing instructions for the [Chainstack console](https://console.chainstack.com/). Instead, use Chainstack.

- Correct: On Chainstack, navigate to your node details
- Incorrect: In the platform UI, navigate to your node details

## Word usage
