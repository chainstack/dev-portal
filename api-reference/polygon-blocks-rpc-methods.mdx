This information can be used to track the state of the blockchain and for:

* **Blockchain analysis** — insights into the overall activity on the network, such as the number of processed transactions and average transaction fees, can be obtained.
* **Block explores** — web-based tools that provide access to information on a blockchain, including block data, transactions, and addresses, allowing users to search, view, and analyze the network's activity.
* **Smart contract analysis** — the activity of specific smart contracts
* **DApp development** — block information can be utilized in the development of decentralized applications.
