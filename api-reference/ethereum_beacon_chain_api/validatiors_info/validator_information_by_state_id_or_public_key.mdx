---

The `/eth/v1/beacon/states/{state_id}/validators/{validator_id}` endpoint retrieves detailed information about a specific validator within a given state of the Beacon Chain. This endpoint is crucial for obtaining in-depth data about individual validators, including their status, balances, and participation in the Ethereum network.

### Parameters

* `state_id` — the identifier of the state for which validator information is requested. Acceptable values for `state_id` include:
  + `head` — represents the latest canonical state in the node's view.
  + `genesis` — refers to the initial state of the Beacon Chain.
  + `finalized` — indicates the most recent state that has been finalized.
  + `justified` — denotes a recently justified state in the Proof of Stake consensus.
  + `<slot>` — a specific time slot in the Ethereum protocol.
  + `<hex encoded stateRoot with 0x prefix>` — a specific state root in hexadecimal format.
* `validator_id` — the identifier of the specific validator. This can be a validator index, public key, or a hexadecimal representation of the validator's public key.

### Response

The response consists of an object with the following fields:

* `data` — an array of objects, each representing a validator, with fields including:
  + `index` — the index number of the validator.
  + `balance` — the current balance of the validator in Gwei.
  + `status` — the current status of the validator, with possible values:
    - `pending_initialized` — awaiting sufficient balance for activation.
    - `pending_queued` — queued for activation.
    - `active_ongoing` — actively participating in the consensus process.
    - `active_exiting` — requested to exit, but not yet exited.
    - `active_slashed` — slashed and awaiting exit.
    - `exited_unslashed` — exited without being slashed.
    - `exited_slashed` — exited due to being slashed.

    - `withdrawal_credentials` — required credentials for fund withdrawal.
    - `effective_balance` — the validator's effective balance in Gwei.
    - `slashed` — indicates if the validator has been slashed.
    - `activation_eligibility_epoch` — eligibility epoch for activation.
    - `activation_epoch` — the epoch of validator activation.
    - `exit_epoch` — the epoch of validator exit.
    - `withdrawable_epoch` — the epoch after which withdrawal is possible.
