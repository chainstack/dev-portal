title: Beacon headers by block_id
openapi: "/openapi/ethereum_beacon_chain_api/state/getBeaconHeadersByBlockId.json GET /0a9d79d93fb2f4a4b1e04695da2b77a7/eth/v1/beacon/headers/{block_id}"
---

The `/eth/v1/beacon/headers/{block_id}` method is an important API endpoint in the Ethereum Beacon Chain, focused on providing header information for a specified beacon block. Block headers are crucial in blockchain technology as they contain key information about the block without the need to process the entire block data. This endpoint is particularly valuable for developers and network participants who require quick and efficient access to block information for validation, analysis, or synchronization purposes.

## Parameters

* `{block_id}`: This parameter specifies the identifier of the beacon block for which the header information is being requested. The block identifier can be a slot number, a block root, or a special value like 'genesis' or 'head'.

## Response

* `object` — beacon block header information.
  + `root` — the root of the beacon block, serving as a unique cryptographic identifier for the block.
  + `canonical` — a boolean indicating whether the block is part of the canonical chain.
  + `header` — the actual block header information, including:
    - `slot`: The slot number at which the block was proposed.
    - `proposer_index`: The index of the validator who proposed the block.
    - `parent_root`: The root of the parent block, linking to the chain's continuity.
    - `state_root`: The root of the beacon chain state after the block's effect.
    - `body_root`: The root of the block's body, encapsulating transactions, attestations, and other block content.

The `/eth/v1/beacon/headers/{block_id}` method is a key tool in the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling a streamlined and efficient way to access vital block header information. It aids in enhancing the blockchain's transparency and accessibility, vital for a wide range of blockchain-related operations and analyses.
