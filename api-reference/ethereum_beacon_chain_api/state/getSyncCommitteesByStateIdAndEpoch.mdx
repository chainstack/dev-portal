title: Sync committees by state and epoch
openapi: /openapi/ethereum_beacon_chain_api/state/getSyncCommitteesByStateIdAndEpoch.json
  GET /beacon/states/{state_id}/sync_committees
---

The `/eth/v1/beacon/states/{state_id}/sync_committees` method is an integral API endpoint in the Ethereum Beacon Chain. It provides detailed information about the current sync committee composition for a given state. Sync committees are groups of validators responsible for contributing to the consensus process and are especially important for the functioning of light clients, which rely on these committees to stay synchronized with the main chain.

## Parameters

* `{state_id}`: This parameter specifies the state identifier for which the sync committee information is being requested. It can be a specific slot number, an epoch number, a block root, or special values like 'genesis' or 'head'.

## Response

* `object` — sync committee information.
  + `data` — the structure containing the sync committee details, including:
    - `validators` — a list of validator indices that are members of the sync committee. These indices identify the validators participating in the committee.
    - `validator_aggregates` — a list of aggregated sets of validators. Each set represents a group of validators working together within the sync committee.
    - `pubkeys` — the public keys of the validators in the sync committee, used for cryptographic operations and validator identification.
    - `aggregate_pubkey` — the combined public key of the entire sync committee. This key represents the collective entity of the committee for cryptographic purposes.

The `/eth/v1/beacon/states/{state_id}/sync_committees` method is crucial for understanding the current composition and operation of sync committees within the Ethereum network. This information is vital for validators, developers, and participants who need to interact with or analyze the sync committees, ensuring effective and secure network operation.
