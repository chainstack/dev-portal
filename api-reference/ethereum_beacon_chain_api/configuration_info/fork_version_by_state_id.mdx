title: Fork version by state ID
openapi: /openapi/ethereum_beacon_chain_api/configuration_info/fork_version_by_state_id.json
  GET /0a9d79d93fb2f4a4b1e04695da2b77a7/eth/v1/beacon/states/{state_id}/fork
---

The `/eth/v1/beacon/states/{state_id}/fork` method provides information about the fork version and epoch associated with a given state. This endpoint is essential for understanding the current and previous fork versions that the Beacon state has undergone and the epoch at which the latest fork has occurred.

## Parameters

* `state_id` — the identifier for the state for which fork information is being requested. The `state_id` can be:
  + `head` — represents the latest canonical state in the node's view.
  + `genesis` — refers to the state at the genesis or the start of the Beacon Chain.
  + `finalized` — the state that is finalized and accepted by the network with minimal likelihood of reorganization.
  + `justified` — a state that has recently achieved justification, which is a precursor to finalization in the Ethereum 2.0 proof of stake mechanism.
  + `<slot>` — specific slot number in the Ethereum 2.0 protocol timeline.
  + `<hex encoded stateroot with 0x prefix>` — the specific state root of interest, encoded in hexadecimal format.

## Response

The response is an object containing the following fields:

* `execution_optimistic` — a boolean indicating if the response is based on an unverified execution payload. If `true`implies that the payload might be invalidated later. The absence of this field implies a default value of `false`.
* `finalized` — a boolean indicating if the response pertains to the finalized history of the chain. If absent, it suggests the need for additional calls to determine the epoch’s relation to the finalized checkpoint.
* `data` — an object containing:
  + `previous_version` — a hexadecimal string representing the fork version of the state before the current fork.
  + `current_version` — a hexadecimal string indicating the fork version of the current state.
  + `epoch` — the epoch number at which the current version was adopted.
