openapi: /openapi/optimism_node_api/eth_getStorageAt.json POST /efb0a5eccd2caa5135eb54eba6f7f300

Optimism API method `eth_getStorageAt` retrieves the value from a specific storage position of a contract at a given address. This method is useful for inspecting the state of smart contracts at specific points in their execution or at a particular block.

This example makes a call to slot 7 of the [USDC contract](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85) on the Optimism Mainnet.

## Parameters

* `address` — the address of the contract to access.
* `position` — the storage position to inspect, given as a hexadecimal value.
* `block` — the block number (in hexadecimal) or one of the strings `"earliest"`, `"latest"`, or `"pending"`, indicating the state to consider. The default is `"latest"`.

## Response

* `result` — the value from the specified storage position at the given address, returned as a hexadecimal string.

## Use case

The `eth_getStorageAt` method is essential for:

* Developers and auditors who need to verify the state and behavior of smart contracts by inspecting their storage.
* DApps that require access to contract state that is not exposed through contract methods.
* Tools and services that monitor contract state for changes, updates, or anomalies.
