title: eth_call | Optimism
openapi: /openapi/optimism_node_api/eth_call.json POST /efb0a5eccd2caa5135eb54eba6f7f300
---

The example is a call to the `poolinfo` of the [Gamma MasterChef contract](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xc7846d1bc4d8bcf7c45a7c998b77ce9b3c904365#readContract).

Optimism API method `eth_call` executes a smart contract function call directly and returns the result without requiring a transaction or changing the state on the blockchain. This method is widely used for reading data from smart contracts.

## Parameters

* `transactionObject` — an object containing transaction parameters, including:
  + `to` — the address of the contract to call.
  + `data` — the call data, typically including the function signature and parameters.
* `blockParameter` — a string specifying the block number (in hexadecimal) or one of the strings `"earliest"`, `"latest"`, or `"pending"`, indicating the blockchain state to use for the call. Most commonly, `"latest"` is used.

## Response

* `result` — the result of the call, encoded as a hexadecimal string. The format of the result depends on the function called.

## Use case

The `eth_call` method is essential for:

* DApps that need to retrieve state or compute derived values from smart contracts without making a transaction.
* Wallets and interfaces that display contract information, such as token balances or the state of a decentralized finance (DeFi) contract.
* Automated scripts and bots that monitor contract states or conditions on the blockchain.
