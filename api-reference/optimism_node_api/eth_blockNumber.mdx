## Parameters

* `none`

## Response

* `result` — the integer value of the node's latest block number is synced to, encoded as hexadecimal. The block number is used to identify the block's position in the blockchain and is updated every time a new block is added to the chain.

## Use case

A possible use case for the `eth_blockNumber` method in Optimism is for applications that need to be aware of the current block number—some applications may need to be mindful of the current block number to function correctly. For example, a DApp may use the current block number to determine the expiration date of a time-limited offer.
