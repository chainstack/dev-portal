## What is the BASE protocol?

BASE is a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain developed by Coinbase. It aims to provide a more scalable and efficient environment for decentralized applications (dApps) by leveraging Optimistic Rollups, a type of Layer 2 scaling technology. BASE inherits the security and decentralization of Ethereum while offering higher throughput and lower transaction costs.

Find useful BASE tools in the [BASE tooling](/docs/base-tooling) section.

## What is the BASE API

The BASE API allows developers to communicate with the BASE blockchain to build applications.

Chainstack BASE nodes provide both execution layer API and consensus layer API.

An application must connect to a BASE RPC node to read data from and send transactions to the BASE blockchain.

When communicating with a BASE RPC node, the client implements a JSON-RPC specification, a communication protocol allowing one to make remote calls and execute them as if they were made locally.

## How to start using the BASE API

You need access to a BASE RPC node to use the BASE API.

Follow these steps to sign up on Chainstack, deploy a BASE RPC node, and find your endpoint credentials:

<Steps>
<Step>
[Sign up with Chainstack](https://console.chainstack.com/user/account/create).
</Step>
<Step>
[Deploy a node](/docs/manage-your-networks#join-a-public-network).
</Step>
<Step>
[View node access and credentials](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).
</Step>
</Steps>
Now, you can connect to the BASE blockchain and use the BASE API to build.
