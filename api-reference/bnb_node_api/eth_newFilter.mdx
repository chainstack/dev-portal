title: eth_newFilter | BNB Chain
openapi: /openapi/bnb_node_api/eth_newFilter.json POST /35848e183f3e3303c8cfeacbea831cab
---

BNB API method that generates a filter object based on the filter parameters. It returns a filter ID, which can be used to retrieve the filter results using the [eth\_getFilterChanges](/api-reference/bnb_node_api/eth_getFilterChanges) method. By creating a filter for specific events, developers can receive notifications when those events occur and use them to trigger actions in their applications.

## Parameters

* `object` — the filter parameters:
  + `fromBlock` — (optional, default: `latest`) integer that specifies the starting block number from which the logs should be fetched.
  + `toBlock` — (optional, default: `latest`) integer that specifies the ending block number until which the logs should be fetched.
  + `address` — (optional) the contract address from which the logs should be fetched. It can be a single address or an array of addresses.
  + `topics` — (optional) an array of `DATA` topics. The event topics for which the logs should be fetched. It can be a single topic or an array of topics.
  + `blockhash` — (optional) the hash of the specific block. Limits logs to a specific block with a 32-byte hash value. It takes precedence over `fromBlock` and `toBlock`.

  
<Note>
**Possible tags forfromBlockandtoBlock**

* `latest` — the most recent block in the blockchain and the current state of the blockchain at the most recent block.
* `safe` — the block that received justification from the beacon chain. Although this block could be involved in a chain reorganization, it would necessitate either a coordinated attack by the majority of validators or an instance of severe propagation latency.
* `finalized` — the block accepted as canonical by more than 2/3 of the validators. A chain reorganization is extremely unlikely, and it would require at least 1/3 of the staked ETH to be burned.
* `earliest` — the earliest available or genesis block.
* `pending` — the pending state and transactions block. The current state of transactions that have been broadcast to the network but have not yet been included in a block.

See the [default block parameter](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block) and [How The Merge Impacts Ethereum’s Application Layer](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer).
</Note>


## Response

* `result` — a hexadecimal string representing the ID of the newly created filter

<Warning>
The filters created are stored on the blockchain client instance. The filter is automatically deleted if not polled within a certain time (5 minutes by default).
</Warning>


Use the following methods with the filter ID:

* [eth\_getFilterChanges](/api-reference/bnb_node_api/eth_getFilterChanges) to retrieve updated logs
* [eth\_uninstallFilter](/api-reference/bnb_node_api/eth_uninstallFilter) to remove the filter

## `eth_newFilter` code examples

<Note>
Note that the `web3.eth.filter` methods have been deprecated and replaced with the `web3.eth.subscribe` in web3.js. See [web3.js subscriptions](/api-reference/ethereum-web3js-subscriptions-methods).

## Use case

You can use `eth_newFilter` to create a filter for a specific action on a smart contract, for example, to monitor the transfer transactions from the [Wrapped BNB token](https://bscscan.com/token/0xbb4CdB9CBd36B01bD1cBaEBF2De08d9173bc095c).

The idea is to create a filter using the `eth_newFilter` method to monitor an ERC-20 smart contract, WBNB in this case.
