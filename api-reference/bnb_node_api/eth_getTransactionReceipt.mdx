BNB API method that retrieves a transaction's receipt from a transaction hash. It can be used to verify a transaction's success or failure, check a smart contract's execution status, retrieve logs, check if a transaction deployed a smart contract and more.

## Parameters

* `hash` — the hash identifying a transaction

## Response

* `Transaction receipt` — the receipt object with:
  + `blockHash` — the block hash. Identifies the block in which the transaction was included. This field is `null` for transactions that have not yet been included in a block.
  + `blockNumber` — the number of the block in which the transaction was included. This field is `null` for transactions that have not yet been included in a block.
  + `contractAddress` — the contract address created by the transaction if it was a contract creation transaction. Otherwise, the value is `null`.
  + `cumulativeGasUsed` — the total amount of gas used in the block until this transaction was executed.
  + `effectiveGasPrice` — the actual value deducted from the sender's account for this transaction.
  + `from` — the address of the sender who initiated the transaction.
  + `gasUsed` — the amount of gas used by this specific transaction alone.
  + `logs` — an array of log objects this transaction generates, if any. Logs are generated by smart contracts.
  + `logsBloom` — the bloom filter used by light clients to quickly retrieve logs related to the transaction.
  + `status` — the success status of the transaction, represented as `1` for success or `0` for failure.
  + `to` — the recipient's address of the transaction if it was a transaction to an address. For contract creation transactions, this field is `null`.
  + `transactionHash` — the hash that uniquely identifies the transaction.
  + `transactionIndex` — the index of the transaction within the block.
  + `type` — the [type](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/#types-of-transactions) of the transaction. `0` indicates a regular transfer; `2` indicates a contract creation or smart contract function call.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript web3.js
const { Web3 } = require("web3");
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

async function getReceipt(transactionHash) {
  const receipt = await web3.eth.getTransactionReceipt(transactionHash)
  console.log(receipt)
 }
 
 getReceipt("0x4cdc1e231274ffd15a30384eab7f45c9e42cd5aaa79d874f1cd23c52dfabe4b8")
```

```javascript ethers.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);

const getTransactionReceipt = async (transactionHash) => {
    const receipt = await provider.send("eth_getTransactionReceipt", [transactionHash]);
     console.log(receipt);
   };

getTransactionReceipt('0x4cdc1e231274ffd15a30384eab7f45c9e42cd5aaa79d874f1cd23c52dfabe4b8')
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3  
node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL" 

web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url)) 
print(web3.eth.get_transaction_receipt("0x4cdc1e231274ffd15a30384eab7f45c9e42cd5aaa79d874f1cd23c52dfabe4b8"))
```

## Use case

A practical use case for `eth_getTransactionReceipt` is to verify a transaction's status and whether it was successful. This can be especially useful when deploying a contract, as you can use the receipt to confirm that the contract was deployed successfully and has a valid contract address.
