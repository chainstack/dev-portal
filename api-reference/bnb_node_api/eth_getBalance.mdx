openapi: /openapi/bnb_node_api/eth_getBalance.json POST /35848e183f3e3303c8cfeacbea831cab
---

BNB API method that returns the balance of a specific Ethereum account in [Wei](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wei.asp), the smallest unit of ether. This method allows developers to retrieve the current balance of a BNB account for various purposes, such as checking available funds or displaying balance information.

## Parameters

* `address` — the address to check the balance of.
* `quantity or tag` — the integer of a block encoded as hexadecimal or the string with:

  + `latest` — the most recent block in the blockchain and the current state of the blockchain at the most recent block. A chain reorganization is to be expected.
  + `safe`—the block that received justification from the beacon chain. Although this block could be involved in a chain reorganization, it would necessitate either a coordinated attack by the majority of validators or severe propagation latency.
  + `finalized` — the block accepted as canonical by more than 2/3 of the validators. A chain reorganization is extremely unlikely, and it would require at least 1/3 of the staked amount to be burned.
  + `earliest` — the earliest available or genesis block
  + `pending`— the pending state and transactions block. This is the current state of transactions that have been broadcast to the network but have not yet been included in a block.

<Note>
See the [default block parameter](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block) and [How The Merge Impacts Ethereum’s Application Layer](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer).

## Response

* `quantity` — the integer value of the current balance in Wei

```javascript web3.js
const { Web3 } = require("web3");
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

async function getBalance(address, block) {
  const balance = await web3.eth.getBalance(address, block)
  console.log(balance)
 }
 
 getBalance("0x8894E0a0c962CB723c1976a4421c95949bE2D4E3", "latest" )
```

```javascript ethers.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);

const getBalance = async (address, block) => {
    const balance = await provider.send("eth_getBalance", [address, block]);
    console.log(balance);
  };

getBalance("0x8894E0a0c962CB723c1976a4421c95949bE2D4E3", "latest")
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3  
node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL" 

address = web3.to_checksum_address("0x8894E0a0c962CB723c1976a4421c95949bE2D4E3")
balance = web3.eth.get_balance(address, "latest") 
print(balance) 
```

## Use case

One practical use case for `eth_getBalance` is to check the balance of an account for a program that scans the balance periodically and fills up the account when the balance drops below a certain value.
