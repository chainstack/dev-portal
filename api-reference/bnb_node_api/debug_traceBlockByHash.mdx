title: debug_traceBlockByHash | BNB Chain
openapi: /openapi/bnb_node_api/debug_traceBlockByHash.json POST /35848e183f3e3303c8cfeacbea831cab
---

BNB API method that traces the execution of a block. This method can be used to debug and analyze smart contracts and transactions on the BNB blockchain. It provides a detailed trace of the execution of a block, including information on all the transactions and calls that interacted with the block, as well as the gas used, memory, storage operations, and other performance metrics for each operation.

## Parameters

* `hash` — the hash of the block to be traced.
* `tracer` — an object identifying the type of tracer and its configuration:
  + `4byteTracer` — tracer that captures the function signatures and call data sizes for all functions executed during a transaction, creating a map that links each selector and size combination to the number of times it occurred. This provides valuable information about the frequency and usage of each function within the transaction.
  + `callTracer` — tracer that captures information on all call frames executed during a transaction. The resulting nested list of call frames is organized into a tree structure that reflects the way the Ethereum Virtual Machine works and can be used for debugging and analysis purposes.
  + `prestateTracer` — tracer with two modes: `prestate` and `diff`, where the former returns the accounts needed to execute a transaction, and the latter returns the differences between the pre and post-states of the transaction. The tracer operates by re-executing the transaction and tracking every state change made, resulting in an object with the account addresses as keys and the corresponding trie leaves as values.

## Response types

### `4byteTracer` response

* `object` — the `4byteTracer` traces object:
  + `result` — a map of the function signature, the call data size, and how many times the function was called.

### `callTracer` response

* `object` — the `callTracer` traces object:
  + `from` — the address of the sender who initiated the transaction.
  + `gas` — the units of gas included in the transaction by the sender.
  + `gasused` — the total used gas by the call. Encoded as hexadecimal.
  + `to` — the address of the recipient of the transaction if it was a transaction to an address. For contract creation transactions, this field is `null`.
  + `input` — the optional input data sent with the transaction, usually used to interact with smart contracts.
  + `output` — the return value of the call, encoded as a hexadecimal string.
  + `error` — an error message in case the execution failed.
  + `revertReason` — the reason why the transaction was reverted, returned by the smart contract if any.
  + `calls` — a list of sub-calls made by the contract during the call, each represented as a nested call frame object.

### `prestateTracer` response

* `object` — the `prestateTracer` traces object:
  + `smart contract address` — the address of the smart contract associated with the result.
    - `balance` — the balance of the contract, expressed in wei and encoded as a hexadecimal string.
    - `code` — the bytecode of the contract, encoded as a hexadecimal string.
    - `nonce` — the nonce of the account associated with the contract, represented as an unsigned integer.
    - `storage` — a map of key-value pairs representing the storage slots of the contract. The keys and values are both encoded as hexadecimal strings.

```javascript web3.js
const { Web3, Web3PluginBase } = require('web3');
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

// Define the TraceBlockPlugin class
class TraceBlockPlugin extends Web3PluginBase {
    pluginNamespace = 'trace';

    async traceBlockByHash(blockHash, tracer) {
        return this.requestManager.send({
            method: 'debug_traceBlockByHash',
            params: [blockHash, tracer],
        });
    }
}

// Register the plugin
web3.registerPlugin(new TraceBlockPlugin());

// Function to trace block by hash using the custom plugin
async function traceBlockByHash(blockHash) {
    const tracer = { tracer: '4byteTracer' }; // Or any other tracer you want to use
    try {
        const result = await web3.trace.traceBlockByHash(blockHash, tracer);
        console.log(result);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error tracing block by hash:", error);
    }
}

// Call the function with a specific block hash
traceBlockByHash("0x0e77e2cf5a6999f616b56f1378b6c7b127b5a4e20cb2e12611d808af0979dacf");
```

```javascript ethers.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);

const traceBlockByHash = async (blockHash) => {

  // Specify the type of tracer: 4byteTracer, callTracer, or prestateTracer
  const tracer = { tracer: '4byteTracer' };
  const traces = await provider.send("debug_traceBlockByHash", [blockHash, tracer]);
  console.log(traces);
};

traceBlockByHash("0x0e77e2cf5a6999f616b56f1378b6c7b127b5a4e20cb2e12611d808af0979dacf")
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3  
node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL" 
web3 = Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url)

block_hash = "0x0e77e2cf5a6999f616b56f1378b6c7b127b5a4e20cb2e12611d808af0979dacf"

# Specify the type of tracer: 4byteTracer, callTracer, or prestateTracer
tracer = { "tracer": '4byteTracer' }
block_traces = web3.provider.make_request('debug_traceBlockByHash', [block_hash, tracer])
print(block_traces)
```

## Use case

One practical use case for `debug_traceBlockByHash` with the `4byteTracer` tracer would be for auditing or analysis purposes of a blockchain.

For example, if there are token contracts on the blockchain and the transfer function of these contracts is used to send tokens between users, a developer could use the `debug_traceBlockByHash` method with the `4byteTracer` tracer to trace the transactions in a given block and count how many times the transfer function was called.
