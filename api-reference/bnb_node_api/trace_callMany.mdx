title: trace_callMany | BNB Chain

BNB API method `trace_callMany` allows for multiple call transactions and returns their trace data. This method is particularly useful for developers who wish to simulate the execution of several transactions in sequence without broadcasting them to the network, enabling a comprehensive analysis of how a series of transactions would interact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and affect the blockchain state.

## Parameters

* `transactions` — an array of objects, each representing a transaction to be executed. Each transaction object includes fields such as `from`, `to`, `gas`, `gasPrice`, `value`, and `data`.
* `traceTypes` — an array of strings specifying the types of traces to return for each transaction, with options including:
  + `vmTrace` — virtual machine trace.
  + `trace` — standard execution trace.
  + `stateDiff` — state difference trace.
* `blockNumber` — the block number against which all the transactions should be executed, with values:
  + `specific block number` — execute against the specified block.
  + `earliest` — the earliest block (usually genesis).
  + `latest` — the most recent block.
  + `pending` — the current pending state and transactions.

## Response

* `result` — An array containing the trace data for each executed transaction, as specified by the `traceTypes`. This data provides detailed insights into the execution path of each transaction, including VM operations, state changes, and other relevant information that helps understand the transactions' impact on the blockchain state.

## Use case

The `trace_callMany`The method is invaluable for developers and analysts who must understand the cumulative effect of multiple transactions on the blockchain state. This could be used to test complex interactions between smart contracts, debug transaction sequences for decentralized applications (DApps), or estimate the gas usage for a series of transactions. It provides a sandbox environment for safely simulating transactions, allowing for thorough testing and analysis without the risk of consuming gas or affecting the live blockchain.
