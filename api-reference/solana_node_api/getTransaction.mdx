# Solana `getTransaction` method

The Solana `getTransaction` method returns detailed information about a specific transaction using its signature.

This method provides comprehensive data about the transaction, including its status, block information, instructions, and more. It's particularly useful for applications that need to verify transaction details or display transaction information to users.

<Note>
**Null response**

The interactive API example is for the [mint transaction of dogwifhat ($WIF](https://solscan.io/tx/4VAGET7z5g7ogVGmbmZ6KBtF6DS8ftLWzD65BXZWQJjwASUqLod7LhGB6mqThcqo97QcC7r7uNmBY8GwsnLAA52n)). The call will respond with null because you need an archive node to retrieve the data in the past. Chainstack does provide Solana archive nodes, so get one.
