The Solana `getBlockTime` method returns the estimated production time of a block.

Note that you need to use the **slot number** as a parameter here, not the block number. See also [Understanding the difference between blocks and slots on Solana](/docs/understanding-the-difference-between-blocks-and-slots-on-solana).

This method provides the Unix timestamp at which the block was produced. It is useful for tracking the timing of transactions and events on the blockchain.

## Use case
