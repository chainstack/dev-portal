## Use case

The `slotsUpdatesUnsubscribe` method is important for proper resource management in applications that use slots updates subscriptions. Common use cases include:

* Cleanup: Remove detailed slot monitoring when no longer needed
* Resource optimization: Free up resources by unsubscribing from unused slot update notifications
* Connection management: Clean up subscriptions during WebSocket disconnections
* Monitoring rotation: Remove old monitoring subscriptions when establishing new ones

By properly managing slots updates subscriptions through unsubscribe calls, applications can maintain optimal performance and prevent unnecessary resource usage.
