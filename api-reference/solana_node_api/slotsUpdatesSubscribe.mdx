title: slotsUpdatesSubscribe | Solana
---

The `slotsUpdatesSubscribe` method in Solana allows developers to receive real-time notifications about slot updates including timing information. This subscription-based method provides more detailed updates about slot processing compared to `slotSubscribe`.

## Parameters

None. This method does not accept any parameters.

## Response

* `result` - An integer subscription id (needed to unsubscribe)
* `subscription` - An object containing detailed slot information:
  + `slot` - The current slot height
  + `timestamp` - The current estimated production time (as Unix timestamp) of the slot
  + `type` - The type of slot update:
    - `"firstShredReceived"` - The first shred of the slot was received
    - `"completed"` - The slot was completed
    - `"createdBank"` - The bank for the slot was created
    - `"frozen"` - The bank for the slot was frozen
    - `"dead"` - The bank for the slot was marked as dead
    - `"optimisticConfirmation"` - The slot was optimistically confirmed
    - `"root"` - The slot was rooted

## `slotsUpdatesSubscribe` code examples

This example subscribes to detailed slot updates.

<Note>
Note that subscriptions require a WebSocket connection and [WebSocket cat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wscat) for you to use this method in the console.

Install WebSocket cat with:

`npm install -g wscat`
</Note>

```shell wscat
$ wscat -c YOUR_CHAINSTACK_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT
# Wait for the connection to be established

Connected (press CTRL+C to quit)

## Use case

The `slotsUpdatesSubscribe` method is valuable for applications that need detailed monitoring of the Solana blockchain's slot processing. Common use cases include:

* Performance monitoring: Track detailed slot processing times and states
* Debugging: Monitor slot processing stages for troubleshooting
* Chain health monitoring: Track slot completion and confirmation rates
* Analytics: Gather detailed metrics about blockchain performance
* Advanced timing: Coordinate operations based on specific slot states

By subscribing to detailed slot updates, applications can gain deeper insights into the blockchain's operation and implement more sophisticated timing and monitoring systems.
