# Solana `getEpochSchedule` method

The Solana `getEpochSchedule` method returns the schedule for epochs in the network.

This method provides detailed information about the schedule for epochs, including the number of slots in each epoch, the number of slots in each warmup period, and more. It is useful for understanding the timing of epochs in the network.

## Parameters

This method does not require any parameters.

## Response

* `value` — the epoch schedule:
  + `slotsPerEpoch` — the number of slots in each epoch.
  + `leaderScheduleSlotOffset` — the number of slots before the start of an epoch to calculate the leader schedule for that epoch.
  + `warmup` — whether epochs start short and grow.
  + `firstNormalEpoch` — the first epoch with `slotsPerEpoch` slots.
  + `firstNormalSlot` — the first slot of `firstNormalEpoch`.

## Use case

A practical use case for `getEpochSchedule` is to understand the timing of epochs in the network. This can be useful for network monitoring tools or other applications that need to display or make use of this information.
