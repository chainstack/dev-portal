title: programSubscribe | Solana
---

The `programSubscribe` method in Solana allows developers to receive real-time notifications about changes to all accounts owned by a specific program. This subscription-based method provides updates whenever any account owned by the monitored program is modified.

## Parameters

* `publicKey` - The program ID (public key) to monitor, as a base-58 encoded string
* `<config>` - (optional) Configuration object:
  + `encoding` - Data encoding for the account data:
    - `"base58"` - Base-58 encoding (default)
    - `"base64"` - Base-64 encoding
    - `"base64+zstd"` - Compressed Base-64 encoding
    - `"jsonParsed"` - JSON format (if program supports it)
  + `filters` - (optional) Array of filter objects:
    - `memcmp` - Filter for memory comparison:
      * `offset` - Number of bytes into program account to start comparison
      * `bytes` - Data to match, as base-58 encoded string
    - `dataSize` - Filter for program account data size
  + `commitment` - (optional) The level of commitment desired when querying state. Default is "finalized".

## Response

* `result` - An integer subscription id (needed to unsubscribe)
* `subscription` - An object containing account information:
  + `pubkey` - The public key of the account that changed
  + `account` - Account information:
    - `lamports` - Number of lamports assigned to the account
    - `owner` - Base-58 encoded public key of the program this account is assigned to
    - `data` - Account data, encoded according to specified encoding parameter
    - `executable` - Boolean indicating if the account contains a program
    - `rentEpoch` - The epoch at which this account will next owe rent

## `programSubscribe` code examples

This example subscribes to all accounts owned by the pump.fun program.

<Note>
Note that subscriptions require a WebSocket connection and [WebSocket cat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wscat) for you to use this method in the console.

Install WebSocket cat with:

`npm install -g wscat`
</Note>

  
```shell wscat
$ wscat -c YOUR_CHAINSTACK_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT
# Wait for the connection to be established

Connected (press CTRL+C to quit)

## Use case

The `programSubscribe` method is particularly useful for applications that need to monitor all accounts associated with a specific program. Common use cases include:

* DEX monitoring: Track changes to orderbooks, market states, and other trading-related accounts
* Token tracking: Monitor token program accounts for transfers and balance changes
* Gaming: Track game state changes across all player accounts
* DeFi applications: Monitor lending pools, staking positions, and other DeFi-related accounts
* Analytics platforms: Gather real-time data about program usage and account state changes

By subscribing to program account changes, applications can provide real-time updates and analytics without constantly polling the blockchain for changes to individual accounts.
