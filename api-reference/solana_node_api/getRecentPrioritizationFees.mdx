# Solana `getRecentPrioritizationFees` method

The `getRecentPrioritizationFees` method returns a list of recent prioritization fees observed in the network. These prioritization fees represent the per-[compute-unit](/docs/solana-glossary#compute-units) fees paid by transactions to gain priority over other transactions in the same block.

The prioritization fee is optional and can be attached to a transaction to increase its likelihood of being included in the next block. A transaction can be prioritized over other transactions with lower or no prioritization fees by paying a higher prioritization fee.

## Parameters

* `array` — an array of base-58 encoded public key strings representing Solana account addresses, with a maximum of 128 addresses.

## Response

The response is an array of objects, where each object represents a prioritization fee observed in a recent slot (block). Each object has the following properties:

* `slot` — the specific slot (or block) on the Solana blockchain where the transactions associated with the prioritization fees were processed.
* `prioritizationFee` — the fee amount paid by at least one transaction within the specified slot to achieve prioritized processing. Specified in [micro-lamports](/docs/solana-glossary#micro-lamports).

## Use case

A practical use case for `getRecentPrioritizationFees` is to understand the current prioritization fee trends in the network. This information can be useful for wallets or other applications that need to determine an appropriate prioritization fee for their transactions. An application can choose a fee level that balances transaction priority and cost by analyzing the recent prioritization fees.
