## `blockUnsubscribe` code examples

<Note>
Note that subscriptions require a WebSocket connection. You can use a WebSocket client library for your programming language of choice to interact with Solana's WebSocket API.
</Note>

```shell wscat
$ wscat -c YOUR_CHAINSTACK_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT
# Wait for the connection to be established

Connected (press CTRL+C to quit)

> {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"blockUnsubscribe","params":[0]}
```


These examples demonstrate how to use the `blockUnsubscribe` method to remove a subscription matching the ID passed as a parameter. Replace `'YOUR_SOLANA_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT'` with your actual Solana WebSocket endpoint URL, and use the correct subscription ID in the `params` array.
