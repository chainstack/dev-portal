title: 'subscribe ("pendingTransactions") | Ethereum'
---

web3.js subscription equivalent to [eth\_newPendingTransactionFilter](/api-reference/ethereum_node_api/transaction_info/eth_newPendingTransactionFilter). `subscribe("pendingTransactions")` allows developers to subscribe to real-time updates about pending transactions on the Ethereum blockchain; the application will receive notifications whenever a pending transaction appears on the blockchain.

If you are using this method to track your own transactions, make sure [MEV protection](/docs/mev-protection) is disabled. Otherwise you won't detect them as they go through a private pool.

## Parameters

* `string` — a keyword identifying the type of event to subscribe to, `pendingTransactions` in this case.
* `function` — (optional) a callback function that will be called every time a new event of the specified type is received. This function takes two parameters: `error` and `result`. The error parameter contains any error that occurred while subscribing to the event, and the result parameter contains the data for the event that was received.

## Response

* `string` — the hash identifying the pending transaction.

## `subscribe("pendingTransactions")` code example

<Info>
  Note that web3.js subscriptions require a WebSocket connection.
</Info>

Use the [event emitter instances](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-subscribe.html#eth-subscription-return) to attach event listeners to the subscription object:

* `data` — activates for each new syncing event:
* `error` — activates if an error is detected during the subscription.
* `connected` — activates after the subscription is successfully connected and returns the subscription ID.
* `unsubscribe` — unsubscribes the subscription and returns `true` if successful.

  ```javascript index.js
  const { Web3 } = require("web3");

  const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_WSS_URL"; // Ensure this is your WebSocket endpoint
  const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

  async function subscribeToPendingTransactions() {
    try {
      // Subscribe to 'pendingTransactions' event
      const subscription = await web3.eth.subscribe('pendingTransactions');

      console.log(`Subscription successful, Subscription ID: ${subscription.id}`);

      // Event listener for new pending transactions
      subscription.on('data', (transaction) => {
        console.log('New pending transaction:', transaction);
      });

      // Event listener for any errors during the subscription
      subscription.on('error', (error) => {
        console.error('Subscription error:', error);
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Error subscribing to pending transactions: ${error}`);
    }
  }

  subscribeToPendingTransactions();
  ```

## Use case

A practical use case for `subscribe("pendingTransactions")` is a DApp that continuously listens for new pending transactions, then isolates the `from`, `to`, and `value` fields for analytics purposes. This is useful, for example, to only track transactions that move at least a certain amount of ETH.

The following is an implementation of this concept using web3.js subscriptions:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript index.js
  const {Web3} = require("web3");
  const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_WSS_URL";
  const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

  async function subscribeToPendingTransactions() {
    try {
        subscription = await web3.eth.subscribe('pendingTransactions');

        console.log("Subscription successful");

        // Event listener for new pending transactions
        subscription.on('data', handleNewPending)

        // Event listener for any errors during the subscription
      subscription.on('error', (error) => {
        console.error('Subscription error:', error);
      });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error subscribing to pending transactions: ${error}`);
    }
  }

  // Adapted to be able to call unsubscribe correctly
  async function unsubscribe() {
    if (!subscription) {
        console.error("No subscription to unsubscribe from.");
        return;
    }

    try {
        await subscription.unsubscribe();
        console.log("Successfully unsubscribed!");
        process.exit(0); // Exiting normally
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error unsubscribing: ${error}`);
        process.exit(1); // Exiting with an error
    }
  }

  // Event listener that logs the received pendingTransactions and extracts from, to, and value fields
  async function handleNewPending(transactionHash) {
    try {
        const transaction = await web3.eth.getTransaction(transactionHash);
        const from = transaction.from;
        const to = transaction.to;
        const value = transaction.value;
        if (value >= BigInt(1000000000000000000)) { // 1 ETH in Wei
            console.log(`----- New pending transaction ------`);
            console.log(`From: ${from}`)
            console.log(`To: ${to}`)
            console.log(`Value: ${Number(web3.utils.fromWei(value, 'ether')).toFixed(2)} ETH \n`)

        }

    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error getting transaction: ${error}`);
    }
  }

  subscribeToPendingTransactions();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This code creates a new subscription to the `pendingTransactions` event using the `web3.eth.subscribe` method. This method returns a subscription object that can be used to attach event listeners to the subscription.

The code defines two event listener functions that are attached to the subscription object: `handleNewPending` and `handleError`. The `handleNewPending` function is called when a new pending transaction is received; it runs the [eth\_getTransactionByHash](/api-reference/ethereum_node_api/transaction_info/eth_getTransactionByHash) method and extracts the `from`, `to`, and `value` fields. If the value transferred is above 1 ETH, the data is logged.

The code includes the `unsubscribe` function that can be implemented in the logic to unsubscribe and exit the program when a condition is met.

Finally, the code calls the `subscribeTopendingTransactions` function, which creates the subscription and attaches the event listeners. When a new pending transaction is received, the `handleNewPending` function is called to extract the data and log it to the console.
