title: eth_call | Base
openapi: /openapi/base_node_api/eth_call.json POST /2fc1de7f08c0465f6a28e3c355e0cb14

The example is a call to the `balanceOf` method on the [USDC contract.](https://basescan.org/address/0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913).

Base API method `eth_call` executes a smart contract function call directly and returns the result without requiring a transaction or changing the state on the blockchain. This method is widely used for reading data from smart contracts.

## Parameters

* `transactionObject` — an object containing transaction parameters, including:
  + `to` — the address of the contract to call.
  + `data` — the call data, typically including the function signature and parameters.
* `blockParameter` — a string specifying the block number (in hexadecimal) or one of the strings `"earliest"`, `"latest"`, or `"pending"`, indicating the blockchain state to use for the call. Most commonly, `"latest"` is used.

## Response

* `result` — the result of the call, encoded as a hexadecimal string. The format of the result depends on the function called.

## Use case

The `eth_call` method is essential for:

* DApps that need to retrieve state or compute derived values from smart contracts without making a transaction.
* Wallets and interfaces that display contract information, such as token balances or the state of a decentralized finance (DeFi) contract.
* Automated scripts and bots that monitor contract states or conditions on the blockchain.
