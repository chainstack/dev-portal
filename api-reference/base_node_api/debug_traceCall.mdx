Executes a call and retrieves a detailed execution trace of the call, similar to a transaction but without creating a transaction on the blockchain. This method is crucial for developers and analysts who need to understand the execution flow of a call, including all the operations (opcodes) executed, gas usage, and the call's outcome.
