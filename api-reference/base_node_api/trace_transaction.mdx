Base API method `trace_transaction` provides a detailed trace of a single transaction's execution. This method is essential for developers, auditors, and blockchain analysts who need to examine the execution steps of a transaction, including contract calls, state changes, and event emissions. It offers insights into the transaction's behavior on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and its impact on the blockchain state.

## Parameters

* `transactionHash` — The hash of the transaction you wish to trace, specified as a hexadecimal string.

## Response

* `result` — An array containing the trace data for the specified transaction. Each element in the array represents a step in the transaction's execution, detailing operations such as calls to other contracts, value transfers, and the execution outcomes.

## Use case

The `trace_transaction` method is invaluable for conducting in-depth analyses of transactions. Developers can use it to debug and optimize smart contract interactions, auditors can employ it to ensure transaction security and integrity, and analysts might use it to investigate transaction patterns or detect anomalies. This method provides a detailed view of how a transaction interacts with the blockchain, which is crucial for understanding its effects and ensuring its correctness.
