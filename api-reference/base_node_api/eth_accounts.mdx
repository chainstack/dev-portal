## Parameters

* `none`

## Response

* `result` â€” an array of 20-byte account addresses owned by the client. For most public nodes, this array will be empty as accounts are not stored on the node for security reasons.

## Use case

The `eth_accounts` method is primarily used in development environments or private networks where accounts are stored locally on the node. In production environments with public nodes, this method typically returns an empty array as accounts should be managed client-side for security reasons.
