## Parameters

* `filterObject` — an object containing filter options:
  + `fromBlock` — the starting block to search for logs. In this example, it's set to `"latest"`.
  + `address` — the contract address to fetch logs from.
  + `topics` — an array of topics to match against the logs.

## Response

* `result` — an array of log objects. Each log object contains details such as whether the log was removed (due to a chain reorganization), log index, transaction index, transaction hash, block hash, block number, address from which the log originated, data contained in the log, and topics associated with the log.

## Use case

The `eth_getLogs` method is essential for:

* DApps that require access to historical log data for analysis or display purposes.
* Services that monitor smart contract interactions over time, needing to retrieve all past events that match certain criteria.
* Analytical tools that process and visualize blockchain data based on logs from specific contracts or transactions.
