## Parameters

* `blockIdentifier` — a string that specifies the block number in hexadecimal format or one of the strings `"earliest"`, `"latest"`, or `"pending"`, indicating which block's receipts to retrieve. For instance, using `"latest"` fetches the receipts for the most recent block.

## Response

* `result` — an array of objects, each representing a transaction receipt within the specified block. Key fields in each receipt include:
  + `transactionHash` — the hash of the transaction.
  + `transactionIndex` — the transaction's index position within the block.
  + `blockHash` — the hash of the block containing the transaction.
  + `blockNumber` — the number of the block containing the transaction.
  + `from` — the address of the sender.
  + `to` — the address of the receiver (`null` for contract creation transactions).
  + `cumulativeGasUsed` — the total amount of gas used in the block up until this transaction.
  + `gasUsed` — the amount of gas used by this transaction.
  + `contractAddress` — the contract address created by the transaction, if any.
  + `logs` — an array of log objects generated by the transaction.
  + `status` — the status of the transaction (`0x1` for success, `0x0` for failure).

## Use case

The `eth_getBlockReceipts` method is crucial for applications requiring comprehensive transactional data from a block, such as:

* Analyzing gas consumption and efficiency across transactions.
* Monitoring smart contract interactions and logging for decentralized applications (DApps).
* Verifying transaction execution outcomes for auditing and security analysis.
