<Warning>
**Use eth_getStorageAt instead**

Chainstack BASE nodes are on Reth. Reth does not support the `debug_storageRangeAt` method. See [Using eth\_getStorageAt instead of debug\_storageRangeAt on Reth](/docs/using-eth_getstorageat-instead-of-debug_storagerangeat-on-reth).
</Warning>


The `debug_storageRangeAt` RPC method retrieves storage entries from a contract at a specific block. This method is useful for developers and analysts who need to inspect the state of a contract's storage at a particular point in time.
