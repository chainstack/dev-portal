Base API method that returns information about an uncle block by block hash and uncle index position. Note that uncles are a concept specific to proof-of-work chains and don't exist in proof-of-stake chains like Base.

## Parameters

* `BLOCK HASH` - 32-byte hash of the block containing the uncle
* `UNCLE INDEX POSITION` - the uncle's index position. It's a hexadecimal value representing the uncle's position in the block's uncle list.

## Response

* `result` â€” A block object with uncle information, or null when no uncle exists at the given index. The block object includes:
  + `number`: The block number
  + `hash`: Hash of the uncle block
  + `parentHash`: Hash of the parent block
  + `nonce`: Hash of the generated proof-of-work
  + `sha3Uncles`: SHA3 of the uncles data in the block
  + `logsBloom`: The bloom filter for the logs of the block
  + `transactionsRoot`: The root of the transaction trie of the block
  + `stateRoot`: The root of the final state trie of the block
  + `receiptsRoot`: The root of the receipts trie of the block
  + `miner`: The address of the beneficiary to whom the mining rewards were given
  + `difficulty`: Integer of the difficulty for this block
  + `totalDifficulty`: Integer of the total difficulty of the chain until this block
  + `extraData`: The "extra data" field of this block
  + `size`: Integer the size of this block in bytes
  + `gasLimit`: The maximum gas allowed in this block
  + `gasUsed`: The total used gas by all transactions in this block
  + `timestamp`: The unix timestamp for when the block was collated

## Use case

The `eth_getUncleByBlockHashAndIndex` method is primarily used in proof-of-work networks for:

* Analyzing blockchain history and network behavior
* Calculating mining rewards (as uncle blocks receive partial rewards)
* Studying network propagation and consensus
* Research and analysis of fork events

Note: In Base, which is a proof-of-stake chain, this method will typically return null as there are no uncle blocks in PoS networks.
