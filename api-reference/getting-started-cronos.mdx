## What is the Cronos Chain?

Cronos Chain is a highly scalable, interoperable, and energy-efficient blockchain network designed to support the development and operation of decentralized applications (DApps) and crypto assets. Launched as part of the Crypto.com ecosystem, Cronos aims to bridge the gap between traditional financial markets and decentralized networks.

At the heart of Cronos Chain's efficiency is its utilization of the **Ethermint** protocol, which enables full compatibility with Ethereum-based applications while operating under a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism. This unique blend facilitates faster transactions and significantly reduces the costs associated with smart contract operations. Cronos Chain's compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) means developers can port existing Ethereum applications onto the Cronos network.

## What is the Cronos Chain API?

The Cronos Chain API enables developers to engage with the Cronos blockchain, streamlining the process of managing and developing decentralized applications.

Chainstack provides access to Cronos nodes, which adhere to the Ethereum JSON-RPC specification for seamless interaction. This uniformity guarantees developers can query and transact on the Cronos Chain as intuitively as on Ethereum-based systems.

Developers need to implement the JSON-RPC protocol to interact with a Cronos Chain RPC node, allowing for remote procedure calls as if they were local functions.

## How to Start Using the Cronos Chain API

Connecting to the Cronos Chain API involves establishing a link to a Cronos RPC node.

Follow these steps to sign up on Chainstack, deploy a Cronos RPC node, and obtain your endpoint credentials:
