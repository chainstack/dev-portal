## What is the BNB Chain?

BNB Chain, formerly known as Binance Smart Chain (BSC), is a decentralized and open-source blockchain network developed by Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Launched in 2020, the BNB Chain aims to provide a high-performance and low-cost platform for developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) and deploy smart contracts.

The BNB Chain is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which means it can run Ethereum-based DApps and smart contracts. However, it uses a different consensus mechanism called [Proof-of-Staked Authority (PoSA)](/docs/web3-infrastructure-glossary#proof-of-staked-authority-posa).

## What is the BNB Chain API?

The BNB Chain API allows developers to communicate with the BNB Chain blockchain to build and interact with decentralized applications.

Chainstack BNB Chain nodes provide access to the BNB Chain API, which follows the Ethereum JSON-RPC specification. This allows developers to read data from and send transactions to the BNB Chain blockchain.

Applications must implement the JSON-RPC protocol to communicate with a BNB Chain RPC node, enabling remote procedure calls and execution as if they were made locally.

## How to start using the BNB Chain API

To use the BNB Chain API, you need access to a BNB Chain RPC node.

Follow these steps to sign up on Chainstack, deploy a BNB Chain RPC node, and find your endpoint credentials:

<Steps>
<Step>
[Sign up with Chainstack](https://console.chainstack.com/user/account/create).
</Step>
<Step>
[Deploy a node](/docs/manage-your-networks#join-a-public-network).
</Step>
<Step>
[View node access and credentials](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).
</Step>
</Steps>

Now, you can connect to the BNB Chain blockchain and use the BNB Chain API to build.
