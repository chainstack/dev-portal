## Parameters

* `seqno` (integer, required) — The sequence number of the masterchain block. Example: `40467413`.

## Response

* `shards` (array) — An array of shard objects, each containing:
  + `workchain` (integer) — The workchain ID.
  + `shard` (string) — The shard identifier.
  + `seqno` (integer) — The sequence number of the shard block.
  + `root_hash` (string) — The root hash of the shard block.
  + `file_hash` (string) — The file hash of the shard block.

## Use case

The `masterchainBlockShardState` method is useful for applications that need to analyze or track the state of shards within the TON blockchain. This information can be valuable for:

1. Blockchain explorers that want to display detailed information about the structure of the TON blockchain.
2. Analytics tools that need to monitor the distribution of shards across workchains.
3. Developers building applications that require knowledge of the current state of shards for optimization or routing purposes.
