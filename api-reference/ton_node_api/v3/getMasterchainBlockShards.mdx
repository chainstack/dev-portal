## Parameters

* `seqno` (integer, required) — The sequence number of the masterchain block. Example: `40467413`.

## Response

* `shards` (array) — An array of shard objects, each containing:
  + `workchain` (integer) — The workchain ID.
  + `shard` (string) — The shard identifier.
  + `seqno` (integer) — The sequence number of the shard block.
  + `rootHash` (string) — The root hash of the shard block.
  + `fileHash` (string) — The file hash of the shard block.

## Use case

The `masterchainBlockShards` endpoint is useful for applications that need to analyze or track the state of shards within a specific masterchain block. This information can be valuable for:

1. Blockchain explorers that want to display detailed information about the structure of the TON blockchain at a specific point.
2. Analytics tools that need to monitor the distribution and state of shards across workchains for a given masterchain block.
3. Developers building applications that require knowledge of the shard structure for optimization or routing purposes.
