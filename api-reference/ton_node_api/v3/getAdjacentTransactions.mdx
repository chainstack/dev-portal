## Parameters

* `hash` (string, required) — The hash of the reference transaction. Example: `a9d39a7f1e5f849835496b052885ed2ac07d54d5e0e11f2b17c3b00e3295a2b0`.
* `direction` (string, required) — The direction of adjacent transactions to retrieve. Possible values: `before`, `after`, or `both`. Default: `both`.
* `limit` (integer, optional) — The maximum number of transactions to return. Default: `128`.
* `offset` (integer, optional) — The number of transactions to skip before starting to return results. Default: `0`.
* `sort` (string, optional) — The sorting order of the transactions. Possible values: `asc` (ascending) or `desc` (descending). Default: `desc`.

## Response

* `transactions` (array) — An array of transaction objects, each containing:
  + `hash` (string) — The transaction hash.
  + `lt` (string) — The logical time of the transaction.
  + `account` (string) — The account address involved in the transaction.
  + `now` (integer) — The timestamp of the transaction.
  + `origStatus` (string) — The original status of the account.

## Use case

The `adjacentTransactions` endpoint is useful for various applications that need to analyze transaction sequences or provide context around specific transactions:

1. Block explorers can use this to show transactions that occurred before and after a specific transaction, helping users understand the transaction flow.
2. Analytics tools can use this endpoint to track transaction chains and analyze patterns in transaction sequences.
3. Wallet applications can provide users with a broader context of their transactions by showing adjacent transactions from the same account or related accounts.
4. Debugging tools for smart contracts can use this to trace the execution flow of transactions and their effects on the blockchain state.
