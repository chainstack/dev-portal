## Parameters

* `workchain` (integer, required) — The ID of the workchain. Example: `-1` for the masterchain.
* `shard` (string, required) — The ID of the shard. Example: `"-9223372036854775808"` for the masterchain.
* `seqno` (integer, required) — The sequence number of the block. Example: `39064874`.

## Response

* `id` (object) — The identifier of the block, containing:
  + `workchain` (integer) — The workchain ID of the block.
  + `shard` (string) — The shard ID of the block.
  + `seqno` (integer) — The sequence number of the block.
  + `root_hash` (string) — The root hash of the block.
  + `file_hash` (string) — The file hash of the block.
* `global_id` (integer) — The global ID of the block.
* `version` (integer) — The version of the block.
* `after_merge` (boolean) — Whether the block was created after a merge.
* `before_split` (boolean) — Whether the block was created before a split.
* `after_split` (boolean) — Whether the block was created after a split.
* `want_merge` (boolean) — Whether the block wants to merge.
* `want_split` (boolean) — Whether the block wants to split.
* `validator_list_hash_short` (integer) — The short hash of the validator list.
* `catchain_seqno` (integer) — The sequence number in the catchain.
* `min_ref_mc_seqno` (integer) — The minimum referenced masterchain sequence number.
* `is_key_block` (boolean) — Whether the block is a key block.
* `prev_key_block_seqno` (integer) — The sequence number of the previous key block.
* `start_lt` (string) — The start logical time of the block.

## Use case

A possible use case for the `getBlockHeader` method in TON is for blockchain explorers, validators, or any application that needs detailed metadata about specific blocks. This method can be used to:

1. Display comprehensive block information in a block explorer.
2. Analyze the structure and evolution of the blockchain, including shard splits and merges.
3. Verify the integrity and sequence of blocks in a custom validation process.
4. Track key blocks and their relationships in the blockchain.
