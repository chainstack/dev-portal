openapi: "/openapi/ton_node_api/v2/detectAddress.json GET /detectAddress"
---

The `detectAddress` method is used to detect the type and format of a TON address. This method provides detailed information about the given address, including its raw form, bounceable and non-bounceable representations, and whether it's a testnet address.

**TON pricing is the same for full, archive, v2, v3**

There's no difference between a full node an archive node in data availability or pricing.  
All data is always available and all node requests are consumed as 1 request unit.

## Parameters

* `address` (string, required) — The address to detect. Example: `EQDtFpEwcFAEcRe5mLVh2N6C0x-_hJEM7W61_JLnSF74p4q2`.

## JSON-RPC example

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v2/jsonRPC' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "detectAddress",
    "params": {
      "address": "EQDtFpEwcFAEcRe5mLVh2N6C0x-_hJEM7W61_JLnSF74p4q2"
    }
  }'
```


## Response

* `raw_form` (string) — The raw form of the address.
* `bounceable` (object) — The bounceable representations of the address:
  + `b64` (string) — The bounceable address in base64 format.
  + `b64url` (string) — The bounceable address in base64url format.
* `non_bounceable` (object) — The non-bounceable representations of the address:
  + `b64` (string) — The non-bounceable address in base64 format.
  + `b64url` (string) — The non-bounceable address in base64url format.
* `given_type` (string) — The type of the given address (e.g., "friendly", "raw").
* `test_only` (boolean) — Indicates whether the address is for testnet use only.

## Use case

A possible use case for the `detectAddress` method in TON is for applications that need to handle various types of TON addresses. This method can be used to:

1. Validate and normalize user-input addresses.
2. Determine the appropriate format to use when interacting with smart contracts.
3. Display different address representations to users based on context.
4. Detect if an address is meant for testnet, preventing accidental use on mainnet.
