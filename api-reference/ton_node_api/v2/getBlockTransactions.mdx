## Parameters

* `workchain` (integer, required) — The ID of the workchain. Example: `-1` for the masterchain.
* `shard` (string, required) — The ID of the shard. Example: `"-9223372036854775808"` for the masterchain.
* `seqno` (integer, required) — The sequence number of the block. Example: `39064874`.
* `count` (integer, optional) — The maximum number of transactions to return. Default: `40`.

## Response

* `id` (object) — The identifier of the block, containing:
  + `workchain` (integer) — The workchain ID of the block.
  + `shard` (string) — The shard ID of the block.
  + `seqno` (integer) — The sequence number of the block.
  + `root_hash` (string) — The root hash of the block.
  + `file_hash` (string) — The file hash of the block.
* `transactions` (array of objects) — An array of transaction objects, each containing:
  + `account` (string) — The account address involved in the transaction.
  + `hash` (string) — The transaction hash.

* `incomplete` (boolean) — Indicates if the returned list of transactions is incomplete.

## Use case

A possible use case for the `getBlockTransactions` method in TON is for blockchain explorers, analytical tools, or any application that needs to examine transactions within specific blocks. This method can be used to:

1. Display transaction details for a given block in a block explorer.
2. Analyze transaction patterns or volumes within specific blocks or shards.
3. Monitor specific accounts by tracking their transactions across blocks.
4. Implement custom indexing or caching mechanisms for transaction data.
