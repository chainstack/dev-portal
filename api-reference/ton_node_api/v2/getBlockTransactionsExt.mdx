## Parameters

* `workchain` (integer, required) — The ID of the workchain. Example: `-1` for the masterchain.
* `shard` (string, required) — The ID of the shard. Example: `"-9223372036854775808"` for the masterchain.
* `seqno` (integer, required) — The sequence number of the block. Example: `39064874`.
* `count` (integer, optional) — The maximum number of transactions to return. Default: `40`.

## Response

* `id` (object) — The identifier of the block, containing:
  + `workchain` (integer) — The workchain ID of the block.
  + `shard` (string) — The shard ID of the block.
  + `seqno` (integer) — The sequence number of the block.
  + `root_hash` (string) — The root hash of the block.
  + `file_hash` (string) — The file hash of the block.
* `transactions` (array of objects) — An array of transaction objects, each containing:
  + `account` (string) — The account address involved in the transaction.
  + `hash` (string) — The transaction hash.

## Use case

A possible use case for the `getBlockTransactionsExt` method in TON is for advanced blockchain explorers, analytical tools, or any application that needs comprehensive transaction data within specific blocks. This method can be used to:

1. Display detailed transaction information for a given block in a block explorer.
2. Perform in-depth analysis of transaction patterns, including message contents and computation details.
3. Monitor specific accounts by tracking their detailed transaction activities across blocks.
4. Implement advanced indexing or data processing mechanisms for transaction data.
