## Use case

A possible use case for the `tryLocateTx` method in TON is for blockchain explorers, wallet applications, or any service that needs to locate a specific transaction with partial information. This method can be used to:

1. Find the full details of a transaction when only the source, destination, and approximate time are known.
2. Verify the existence and details of a transaction in dispute resolution scenarios.
3. Implement advanced search functionality in blockchain explorers.
4. Cross-reference transactions across different data sources or systems.
