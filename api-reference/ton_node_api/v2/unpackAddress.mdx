## Parameters

* `address` (string, required) — The user-friendly address to unpack. Example: `EQDtFpEwcFAEcRe5mLVh2N6C0x-_hJEM7W61_JLnSF74p4q2`.

## Response

* `address` (string) — The unpacked address in raw format. This format typically includes the workchain ID and the raw address without any encoding or checksum.

## Use case

A possible use case for the `unpackAddress` method in TON is for developers building applications that need to interact with the TON blockchain at a lower level. This method can be used to:

1. Convert user-input addresses to the raw format required for certain blockchain operations.
2. Standardize address storage in databases or other backend systems.
3. Prepare addresses for use in smart contract interactions that require the raw format.
4. Verify the validity of a user-friendly address by unpacking it and checking its structure.
