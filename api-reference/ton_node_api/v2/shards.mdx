<Note>
**TON pricing is the same for full, archive, v2, v3**

There's no difference between a full node an archive node in data availability or pricing.  
All data is always available and all node requests are consumed as 1 request unit.

## Parameters

* `seqno` (integer, required) — The sequence number of the masterchain block. Example: `39064874`.

## JSON-RPC examples

```shell Shell
curl -X POST \
  'https://ton-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/f2a2411bce1e54a2658f2710cd7969c3/api/v2/jsonRPC' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "shards",
    "params": {
      "seqno": 39064874
    }
  }'
```


## Response

* `shards` (array of objects) — An array containing information about each shard, where each object includes:
  + `workchain` (integer) — The ID of the workchain to which the shard belongs.
  + `shard` (string) — The ID of the shard.
  + `seqno` (integer) — The sequence number of the shard block.
  + `root_hash` (string) — The root hash of the shard block.
  + `file_hash` (string) — The file hash of the shard block.

## Use case

A possible use case for the `shards` method in TON is for applications or services that need to monitor or analyze the sharding structure of the TON blockchain. This method can be used to:

1. Track the evolution of shards over time by querying this endpoint for different masterchain block heights.
2. Implement shard-aware applications that need to route transactions or queries to specific shards.
3. Analyze the load distribution across different shards in the TON network.
4. Build block explorers that can display detailed shard information for each masterchain block.
