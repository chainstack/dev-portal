Starknet API method that simulates the execution of a list of transactions on a given state.

It provides a simulation of the execution of a list of transactions based on the network's current state and the transactions' parameters. A client or wallet can use this simulation to understand the potential outcome of these transactions if they were to be included in a block.

## Parameters

* `request` — the list of transactions to simulate.
* `block_id` — the hash of the requested block, or number (height) of the requested block, or a block tag, for the block referencing the state or call the transaction on.

## Response

* `result` — the result of the simulation, represented as a list of transaction receipts.

## Use case

A practical use case for `starknet_simulateTransactions` is to simulate the execution of a list of transactions that interact with contracts on StarkNet. This can be useful for testing and debugging purposes, as it allows developers to understand the potential outcome of these transactions without actually executing them on the network.
