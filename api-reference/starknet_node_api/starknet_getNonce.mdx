Starknet API method that returns the nonce for a given account.

It provides the nonce of the account, which is the number of transactions sent from the account's address. This is useful for clients or wallets to determine the nonce to include in a transaction to ensure that the network processes it in the correct order.

## Parameters

* `address` — the string of the address of the account.

## Response

* `result` — the nonce of the account, represented as a hexadecimal string.

## Use case

A practical use case for `starknet_getNonce` is to retrieve the nonce for an account before sending a transaction. The nonce is an important factor in transactions, as it determines the order in which the network processes transactions from a given account. For example, if an account has a nonce of 10, the next transaction sent from that account should include a nonce of 11 to ensure that it is processed after all previous transactions.
