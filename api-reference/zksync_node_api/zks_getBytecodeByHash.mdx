## Parameters

* `hash` — a `H256` string representing the hash of the transaction whose bytecode is being requested. This hash acts as a unique identifier for transactions within the zkSync network.

## Response

The response returns the bytecode of the specified transaction as an array of bytes:

* `result` — the bytecode is returned as an array, with each element representing a byte.

## Use case

For a blockchain analytics platform, understanding the bytecode of transactions can be crucial for analyzing contract interactions, detecting anomalies, or verifying contract logic on the zkSync network. The `zks_getBytecodeByHash` method enables such platforms to fetch transaction bytecode dynamically, providing a powerful tool for in-depth blockchain analysis.
