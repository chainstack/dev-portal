title: zks_getBridgeContracts | zkSync Era
openapi: /openapi/zksync_node_api/zks_getBridgeContracts.json POST /afb8312f3710a5bc469f4c87cad3a2e4
---

The `zks_getBridgeContracts` API method fetches the addresses of the default bridges between Layer 1 (Ethereum) and Layer 2 (zkSync). These bridges are pivotal for transferring ERC-20 tokens across layers, playing an essential role in the zkSync ecosystem by enabling efficient, secure, and low-cost asset transfers. This method is especially useful for developers and applications requiring integration with the default bridging mechanisms provided by zkSync.

## Parameters

* `none`

## Response

The response includes the addresses of the default bridge contracts for ERC-20 tokens between Layer 1 and Layer 2:

* `l1Erc20DefaultBridge` — the default ERC-20 bridge contract address on Layer 1 (Ethereum). This contract is used for initiating transfers from Ethereum to zkSync.
* `l2Erc20DefaultBridge` — the default ERC-20 bridge contract address on Layer 2 (zkSync).

## Use Case

A wallet application integrating cross-layer transfer functionalities can use the `zks_getBridgeContracts` method to dynamically fetch the current default bridge contracts, ensuring that transactions are routed through the appropriate channels.
