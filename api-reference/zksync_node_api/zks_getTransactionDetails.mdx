## Parameters

* `hash` — a string representing the transaction hash (H256 format) for which details are requested.

## Response

The response is a JSON object containing key data points about the specified transaction:

* `ethCommitTxHash` — the transaction hash of the commit phase on Ethereum, marking the transaction's initial recording.
* `ethExecuteTxHash` — the transaction hash of the execute phase on Ethereum, indicating the transaction's execution or application.
* `ethProveTxHash` — the Ethereum transaction hash for the proof phase, providing cryptographic proof of the transaction's correctness.
* `fee` — the fee amount for the transaction, presented in hexadecimal format.
* `gasPerPubdata` — the gas cost per byte of public data included in the transaction, in hexadecimal format.
* `initiatorAddress` — the Ethereum address of the entity that initiated the transaction.
* `isL1Originated` — a boolean flag indicating whether the transaction originated from the Layer 1 (Ethereum) network.
* `receivedAt` — the timestamp indicating when the transaction was received on the Layer 2 (zkSync) network.
* `status` — The current status of the transaction, which can be one of the following:
  + `Pending`: The transaction is in the mempool but has not yet been included in a block.
  + `Included`: The transaction has been included in a block, but the batch containing the block has not yet been committed to the Ethereum network.
  + `Verified`: The transaction has been included in a block and verified. Verification means the transaction has been committed, proven, and executed on the Ethereum L1 network, ensuring its finality and immutability.
  + `Failed`: The transaction is unverified or has failed due to various reasons such as insufficient balance, invalid parameters, or execution errors.

## **Use case**

The `zks_getTransactionDetails` method is particularly useful for applications requiring real-time tracking and verifying transaction statuses. For example, a wallet application can use this method to provide users with up-to-date information on their transactions, including confirmation status, fee details, and the transaction's progression through the zkSync network.
