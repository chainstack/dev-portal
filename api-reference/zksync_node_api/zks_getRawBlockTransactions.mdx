## Parameters

`block` — the block number for which transactions are to be retrieved. It is a `uint32` value indicating the specific block on the zkSync network.

## Response

The response provides a structured JSON object that encapsulates detailed transaction data within the specified block. This data is inclusive of both the execution specifics and relevant L1 network information, described as follows:

* `common_data` — a structured collection of data common to the transaction being executed. This includes general transaction information and metadata.
  + `L1` — details specific to the Layer 1 (Ethereum) network that correlate with the zkSync transaction, comprising:
    - `canonicalTxHash` — the unique hash identifier of the transaction as recorded on the Ethereum network.
    - `deadlineBlock` — the last block by which the transaction must be processed on the Ethereum network to remain valid.
    - `ethBlock` — the specific block number on the Ethereum blockchain in which this transaction was included or referenced.
    - `ethHash` — the transaction hash on the Ethereum network, serving as a direct link to the transaction's Ethereum footprint.
    - `fullFee` — the total transaction fee calculated in hexadecimal format, encompassing all associated costs.
    - `gasLimit` — the upper cap on the gas that can be consumed by the transaction, denoted in hexadecimal format.
    - `gasPerPubdataLimit` — the cost of gas per byte of public data included in the transaction, also in hexadecimal format.
    - `layer2TipFee` — an optional tip fee for prioritizing the transaction on the zkSync network, represented in hexadecimal.
    - `maxFeePerGas` — the maximum amount (in Wei, the smallest ETH unit) that the sender is willing to pay per unit of gas, noted in hexadecimal.
    - `opProcessingType` — indicates the processing approach used for the transaction, distinguishing between standard and priority operations.
    - `priorityQueueType` — identifies the queue type for prioritized transactions, if applicable.
    - `refundRecipient` — the address designated to receive any refunds that may arise from the transaction process.
    - `sender` — the Ethereum address initiating the transaction.
    - `serialId` — a sequential identifier assigned to the transaction, facilitating tracking and management.
    - `toMint` — specifies an address, if any, where new tokens are minted as a result of the transaction.
* `execute` — contains execution-specific information about the transaction, outlined as follows:
  + `calldata` — the encoded data sent with the transaction for interacting with smart contracts, formatted in hexadecimal.
  + `contractAddress` — the address of the smart contract being called or interacted with in the transaction.
  + `factoryDeps` — an array of dependencies required for the contract's execution, relevant in complex transactions or deployments.
  + `value` — the amount in Wei transferred or involved in the transaction, expressed in hexadecimal.
* `received_timestamp_ms` — records the precise moment (in milliseconds since the Unix epoch) when the system received the transaction data, providing a timestamp for data entry.

## **Use Case**

A developer could integrate `zks_getRawBlockTransactions` into a real-time financial tracking app to alert users of high-value transactions. The app provides insights by analyzing transaction patterns and values, helping users make informed investment decisions and monitor the market's pulse directly from the zkSync network.
