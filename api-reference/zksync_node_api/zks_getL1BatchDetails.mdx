## Parameters

* `batch` — an `L1BatchNumber` that specifies the batch number on Layer 1 for which details are being requested.

## Response

Upon execution, the `zks_getL1BatchDetails` method returns a detailed object encompassing various aspects of the specified batch:

* `baseSystemContractsHashes` — contains hashes for key system contracts, offering insight into the infrastructure underpinning the transactions within the batch.
  + `bootloader` — the hash of the bootloader contract, a fundamental component in initializing contract execution.
  + `default_aa` — the hash of the default account abstraction contract, facilitating user interactions with contracts.
* `commitTxHash` — the transaction hash for the commitment phase on the network, highlighting the first step in the transaction lifecycle.
* `committedAt` — the ISO 8601 timestamp marking the commitment of the transaction to the network, providing a precise timeline.
* `executeTxHash` — the hash of the executed transaction, indicating the application of the transaction's effects on the zkSync network.
* `executedAt` — the ISO 8601 timestamp for when the transaction execution took place, marking the conclusion of its network effects.
* `l1GasPrice` — shows the gas price on Layer 1 at the time of the transaction, reflecting the execution cost on Ethereum.
* `l1TxCount` — the count of transactions in this batch on Layer 1, offering insight into the batch's complexity.
* `l2FairGasPrice` — the fair gas price within the zkSync network, guiding transaction cost efficiency on Layer 2.
* `l2TxCount` — the number of transactions processed in the zkSync network for this batch, indicating its activity level.
* `number` — the unique number of the batch.
* `proveTxHash` — the hash of the transaction providing proof on Layer 1, essential for validating the batch's integrity and finality.
* `provenAt` — the ISO 8601 timestamp when the proof transaction was verified on Layer 1, marking a crucial step in batch validation.
* `rootHash` — the root hash of the network state post-transaction, key for ensuring the consistency and integrity of the network state.
* `status` — the current status of the batch, providing immediate insight into its processing stage and overall health.
* `timestamp` — a UNIX timestamp that marks the exact time of batch processing, serving as a universal reference point.

## Use case

A smart contract developer optimizing a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform on zkSync could use the `zks_getL1BatchDetails` method to analyze gas usage across different batches. By examining details like gas prices, transaction counts, and execution times, the developer can identify patterns of high gas costs.
