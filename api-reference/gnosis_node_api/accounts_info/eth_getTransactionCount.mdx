Gnosis Chain API method that returns the number of transactions sent from an address at the selected block. This value is also called `nonce`; it is an important piece of information, especially to ensure that a transaction is not sent twice.

## Parameters

* `address`— the address to retrieve the transaction count.
* `quantity or tag` — the integer of a block encoded as hexadecimal or the string with:

  + `latest` — the most recent block in the blockchain and the current state of the blockchain at the most recent block. A chain reorganization is to be expected.
  + `safe` — the block that received justification from the beacon chain. Although this block could be involved in a chain reorganization, it would necessitate either a coordinated attack by the majority of validators or an instance of severe propagation latency.
  + `finalized` — the block accepted as canonical by more than 2/3 of the validators. A chain reorganization is extremely unlikely, and it would require at least 1/3 of the staked ETH to be burned.
  + `earliest` — the earliest available or genesis block
  + `pending` — the pending state and transactions block. The current state of transactions that have been broadcast to the network but have not yet been included in a block.

<Note>
See the [default block parameter](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#the-default-block-parameter) and [How The Merge Impacts Ethereum’s Application Layer](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer).
</Note>


## Response

* `quantity` — an integer value identifying the number of transactions sent from an address at the specified block.

```javascript web3.js
const Web3 = require("web3");
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

async function getTransactionsCount(address, blockId) {
  const count = await web3.eth.getTransactionCount(address, blockId)
  console.log(count);
}

getTransactionsCount("0xc448b51CF665210419543C5A53F13B8cE87834B2", 'latest')
```

```javascript ethers.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);

const getNonce = async (address, blockId) => {
    const nonce = await provider.send("eth_getTransactionCount", [address, blockId]);
    console.log(nonce);
  };

  getNonce("0xc448b51CF665210419543C5A53F13B8cE87834B2", "latest")
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3  
node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL" 

web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url)) 
print(web3.eth.get_transaction_count("0xc448b51CF665210419543C5A53F13B8cE87834B2", "latest")) 
```

## Use case

One of the most common use cases for `eth_getTransactionCount`is to create the transaction object built in a script designed to send a transaction. The nonce field is required, and it is retrieved using the `eth_getTransactionCount` method.

The following code shows how to build a `rawTransction` using web3.js and ethereumjs-tx.

<Warning>
**Security notice**

You need your private key to sign the transaction; never share your private key with anyone.

On a side note, the private key in this case must be imported without '0x' at the beginning of the string.
</Warning>

```javascript index.js
const Web3 = require("web3");
const Tx = require("ethereumjs-tx").Transaction;

const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

// Initialize private key
const PRIVATE_KEY = Buffer.from("PRIVATE_KEY", "hex");

// Validate input parameters and return an error message if invalid
const validateInputs = (fromAddress, toAddress) => {
  if (!web3.utils.isAddress(fromAddress)) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid fromAddress: ${fromAddress}`);
  }
  if (!web3.utils.isAddress(toAddress)) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid toAddress: ${toAddress}`);
  }
};

// Async function to create a raw transaction
async function createRawTransaction(fromAddress, toAddress, value) {
  validateInputs(fromAddress, toAddress);

  const nonce = await web3.eth.getTransactionCount(fromAddress);
  const gasPrice = await web3.eth.getGasPrice();
  const gasLimit = await web3.eth.estimateGas({
    from: fromAddress,
    to: toAddress,
  });

  // Build the transaction object
  const transactionObject = {
    to: toAddress,
    gasPrice: web3.utils.toHex(gasPrice),
    gasLimit: web3.utils.toHex(gasLimit),
    nonce: web3.utils.toHex(nonce),
    value: web3.utils.toHex(value),
  };

  // Create a new transaction object to sign
  const tx = new Tx(transactionObject, { chain: 'mainnet' });

  // Sign the transaction using the private key
  tx.sign(PRIVATE_KEY);

  // Serialize and return the signed transaction as a raw transaction
  const serializedTx = tx.serialize();
  const rawTransaction = `0x${serializedTx.toString('hex')}`;
  
  return rawTransaction;
}

async function main() {
  const rawTransaction = await createRawTransaction('0x6f46cf5569aefa1acc1009290c8e043747172d89', "0xe341b2f448eb190495ed4a89c01f20078b26b0f6" , "100000000000000")
  console.log(`Raw transaction: ${rawTransaction}`)
}

main()
```


In summary, the code creates a valid raw transaction that can be broadcasted to the network.

During the process, the script retrieves important values such as the `nonce`, `gasPrice`, and `gasLimit`, builds a transaction object, and signs it using a private key.

First, the `createRawTransaction` function calls `validateInputs` to ensure that the `fromAddress` and `toAddress` parameters are valid addresses. If either of these addresses is invalid, the function throws an error with a descriptive message.

Next, the function makes a call to `web3.eth.getTransactionCount` with the `fromAddress` as a parameter. This method returns the number of transactions sent from the `fromAddress`, and is used as the `nonce` for the transaction.

The function retrieves the `gasPrice` and `gasLimit` for the transaction using `web3.eth.getGasPrice` and `web3.eth.estimateGas`, respectively. The [eth\_gasPrice](/api-reference/gnosis_node_api/gas_data/eth_gasPrice) is the amount of gas that the transaction sender is willing to pay per unit of gas consumed by the transaction, while the [eth\_estimateGas](/api-reference/gnosis_node_api/gas_data/eth_estimateGas) is an estimate of the maximum amount of gas that the transaction will consume.

With the `nonce`, `gasPrice`, and `gasLimit` values, the function builds a transaction object, which includes the `toAddress`, `gasPrice`, `gasLimit`, `nonce`, and `value` of the transaction. The value is the amount transferred from the `fromAddress` to the `toAddress`.

The transaction object is then passed to a new `Tx` instance, which is signed using the private key. The signed transaction is then serialized and returned as a `rawTransaction`, which can be broadcasted to the network to execute the transaction using [eth\_sendRawTransaction](/api-reference/gnosis_node_api/execute_transactions/eth_sendRawTransaction).
