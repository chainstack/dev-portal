## What is the Polygon protocol?

Polygon is an EVM-compatible sidechain and one of Ethereum's [scaling solutions](https://chainstack.com/solving-the-blockchain-trilemma-scaling-solutions-for-ethereum/) to help reduce costs and increase efficiency.

Polygon runs independently from the Ethereum chain, has its own consensus mechanism, and can bridge assets between the two networks.

Find useful Polygon tools in the [Polygon tooling](/docs/polygon-tooling) section.

## What is the Polygon API

The Polygon API allows developers to communicate with the Polygon blockchain to build applications.

To read data from and send transactions to the Polygon blockchain, an application must connect to a Polygon RPC node.

When communicating with a Polygon RPC node, the Polygon client implements a JSON-RPC specification, a communication protocol allowing one to make remote calls and execute them as if they were made locally.

## How to start using the Polygon API

To use the Polygon API, you need access to a Polygon RPC node.

Follow these steps to sign up on Chainstack, deploy a Polygon RPC node, and find your endpoint credentials:

<Steps>
<Step>
[Sign up with Chainstack](https://console.chainstack.com/user/account/create).
</Step>
<Step>
[Deploy a node](/docs/manage-your-networks#join-a-public-network).
</Step>
<Step>
[View node access and credentials](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).
</Step>
</Steps>

Now you are ready to connect to the Polygon blockchain and use the Polygon API to build.
