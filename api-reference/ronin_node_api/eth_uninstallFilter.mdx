Ronin API method that allows for the removal of a filter previously installed on the Ronin node. This method is crucial for resource management, ensuring that filters are only kept as long as they are needed and are cleaned up afterwards.

**Disclaimer**

Note that the default interactive example in this page will not work as the filter will be expired.

To test `eth_uninstallFilter` in this page, first create a new filter using one of the following:

* [eth\_newFilter](/api-reference/ronin_node_api/eth_newFilter)
* [eth\_newPendingTransactionFilter](/api-reference/ronin_node_api/eth_getFilterChanges)
* [eth\_newBlockFilter](/api-reference/ronin_node_api/eth_newFilter)

Then use the fresh filter ID as the parameter for `eth_uninstallFilter`.
</Warning>


## Parameters

* `filter_id` — a single filter identifier as a hexadecimal string. This is the ID of the filter that was returned by `eth_newFilter` or `eth_newBlockFilter` and is now being uninstalled.

## Response

* `result` — a boolean value indicating the success of the uninstallation. `true` if the filter was successfully uninstalled, otherwise `false`. This allows clients to verify that resources have been freed up appropriately.

## Use case

The `eth_uninstallFilter` method is used to manage the lifecycle of filters in decentralized applications. It is particularly useful in scenarios where an application dynamically creates filters to track specific events or logs and needs to clean them up after they are no longer necessary, helping to prevent resource leaks and maintain optimal performance.
