title: eth_call | Ronin
openapi: /openapi/ronin_node_api/eth_call.json POST /3997273fc956a67dc6982384500e669e
---

The interactive example here is a call to the Ronin Staking Vesting contract. Specifically, to the `lastBlockSendingBonus` function. The data `0x0d9160e7` in the call is the signature for the function `lastBlockSendingBonus`. You can generate the function signature using Chainstack's [Web3Tools](https://web3tools.chainstacklabs.com/generate-solidity-functions-signature) by typing `lastBlockSendingBonus()` into the function name field.

Ronin API method `eth_call` allows for executing a message call transaction, which directly interacts with a smart contract method without creating a transaction on the blockchain. This is particularly useful for read-only operations that don't require a transaction to be committed to a block.

## Parameters

* `object` - The transaction call object:
  + `to`: The address of the contract to call.
  + `data`: The data to send to the contract. This is usually the method signature and encoded parameters.
* `string` - The block number or string (`latest`, `earliest`, `pending`) specifying the state to use for executing the call.

## Response

* `result` - The return value of the executed contract method, encoded in data. This could be a direct value or a set of values depending on the contract's method called.

## Use case

The `eth_call` method is essential for interacting with smart contracts when you need to query their state or execute their read-only methods. For example, getting the balance of a token for a specific address, checking the status of a decentralized application, or any other operation that doesn't change the state of the blockchain.
