title: debug_traceCall | Ronin
openapi: /openapi/ronin_node_api/debug_traceCall.json POST /3997273fc956a67dc6982384500e669e
---

The interactive example here is a call to the Ronin Staking Vesting contract. Specifically, to the `lastBlockSendingBonus` function. The data `0x0d9160e7` in the call is the signature for the function `lastBlockSendingBonus`. You can generate the function signature using Chainstack's [Web3Tools](https://web3tools.chainstacklabs.com/generate-solidity-functions-signature) by typing `lastBlockSendingBonus()` into the function name field.

The `debug_traceCall` method allows for the execution of a call directly on the node, similar to `eth_call`, but with the added benefit of returning detailed execution traces. This method is invaluable for debugging contract interactions by providing insights into the execution flow, state changes, and gas usage without requiring a transaction to be committed to a block.

## Parameters

* `object` - The transaction call object, which includes:
  + `to`: The address of the contract to call.
  + `data`: The data to send to the contract, typically including the method signature and encoded parameters.
* `string` - The block number or string (`latest`, `earliest`, `pending`) specifying the state to use for executing the call.

## Response

* `result` - An object containing the detailed execution trace of the call. This includes information on gas usage, the operations performed, and any state changes that occurred as a result of the call's execution.

## Use case

The `debug_traceCall` method is particularly useful for developers during the contract development and debugging phase. It provides a powerful tool for analyzing how contract methods behave when invoked, identifying potential issues, and optimizing gas usage.
