## Parameters

* `blockHash` — the hash of the block.
* `fullTransactionObjects` — if set to `true`, returns the full transaction objects; if `false`, only the hashes of the transactions.

## Response

* `result` — an object containing information about the block, such as the block number (`number`), the hash of the block (`hash`), the hash of the parent block (`parentHash`), and, depending on the `fullTransactionObjects` parameter, either a list of transaction hashes or a list of transaction objects.

## Use case

The `eth_getBlockByHash` method is useful for applications that need detailed information about specific blocks in the blockchain. For example, a blockchain explorer might use this method to display detailed information about a block, including its transactions, when a user searches for a block by its hash.
