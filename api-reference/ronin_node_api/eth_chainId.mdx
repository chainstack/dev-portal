## Parameters

* None

## Response

* `result` - The chain ID of the current network, returned as a hexadecimal number.

## Use case

Knowing the chain ID is essential for developers when signing transactions, as it ensures that signed transactions are only valid on the intended network. This method provides a straightforward way to programmatically determine the network's chain ID, which is especially useful in applications that operate across multiple Ronin networks.
