title: eth_newPendingTransactionFilter | Aurora
openapi: /openapi/aurora_node_api/eth_newPendingTransactionFilter.json POST /6df1a1b3061097e66349993a96b8e535
---

Aurora API method that creates a filter that listens for new pending transactions on the blockchain. It returns a filter ID, which can be used to retrieve the results using the [eth\_getFilterChanges](/api-reference/aurora_node_api/eth_getFilterChanges) method. The `eth_newBlockFilter` method is useful for developers who must be notified of new blocks on the blockchain in real-time.

## Parameters

* `none`

## Response

* `result` â€” a hexadecimal string representing the ID of the newly created filter

## Code examples

<Warning>
The filters created are stored on the blockchain client instance. The filter is automatically deleted if not polled within a certain time (5 minutes by default).
</Warning>


Use the following methods with the filter ID:

* [eth\_getFilterChanges](/api-reference/aurora_node_api/eth_getFilterChanges) to retrieve updates
* [eth\_uninstallFilter](/api-reference/aurora_node_api/eth_uninstallFilter) to remove the filter

## `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter` code examples

<Note>
Note that the `web3.eth.filter` methods have been deprecated and replaced with the `web3.eth.subscribe` in web3.js. See [web3.js subscriptions](/api-reference/ethereum-web3js-subscriptions-methods).

```javascript ethers.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);

const createFilter = async () => {
  try {
    const filterId = await provider.send('eth_newPendingTransactionFilter', []);
    console.log(filterId); // the filter ID returned by eth_newFilter
    return filterId
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};

createFilter();
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3  
node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL" 
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url))

def get_new_pending_transactions():
    try:
        blocks_filter = web3.eth.filter('pending')

        # Split the string at the space character
        parts = str(blocks_filter).split(' ')

        # Extract the filter value from the second part
        filter_id = parts[2]

        return filter_id
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

new_filter = get_new_pending_transactions()
print(new_filter)
```

## Use case

One way to use the `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter` method is to listen for new pending transactions at predefined intervals and extract specific data from them. For instance, a decentralized application might check for pending transactions every second and identify those that transfer a value greater than a certain amount of the ETH token. This could be useful for real-time monitoring high-value transactions or detecting potential fraud or security threats.
