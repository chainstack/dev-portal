Filters can be created using one of the following methods:

* [eth\_newFilter](/api-reference/aurora_node_api/eth_newFilter)
* [eth\_newBlockFilter](/api-reference/aurora_node_api/eth_newBlockFilter)

After creating a filter using one of the available methods, the resulting filter ID can be used to fetch changes by calling the `eth_getFilterChanges` method.

<Warning>
**Disclaimer**

Note that the default interactive example in this page will not work as the filter will be expired.

To test `eth_getFilterChanges` in this page, first create a new filter using one of the following:

* [eth\_newFilter](/api-reference/aurora_node_api/eth_newFilter)
* [eth\_newBlockFilter](/api-reference/aurora_node_api/eth_newBlockFilter)

Then use the fresh filter ID as the parameter for `eth_getFilterChanges`.
</Warning>


## Parameters

* `string` — the filter ID of the filter for which you want to retrieve the changes

## Response

* `array` — an array that represents the changes that have occurred on the blockchain since the last time the filter was polled:
  + For filters created with `eth_newBlockFilter`:
    - `blockHash` — the hashes of the new blocks since the last time the filter was polled.
  + For filters created with `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter`:
    - `transactionHash` — the hashes identifying new pending transactions since the last time the filter was polled.
  + For filters created with `eth_newFilter`, the following event logs:
    - `address` — the contract address from which the event originated.
    - `topics` — an array of 32-byte data fields containing indexed event parameters.
    - `data` — the non-indexed data that was emitted along with the event.
    - `blocknumber` — the block number in which the event was included. `null` if it is pending.
    - `transactionhash` — the hash of the transaction that triggered the event. `null` if pending.
    - `transactionindex` — the integer index of the transaction within the block's list of transactions. `null` if it is pending.
    - `blockhash` — the hash of the block in which the event was included. `null` if it is pending.
    - `logindex` — the integer identifying the index of the event within the block's list of events. `null` if pending.
    - `removed` — the boolean value indicating if the event was removed from the blockchain due to a chain reorganization. `True` if the log was removed. `False` if it is a valid log.

## `eth_getFilterChanges` code examples

<Note>
Note that the `web3.eth.filter` methods have been deprecated and replaced with the `web3.eth.subscribe` in web3.js. See [web3.js subscriptions](/api-reference/ethereum-web3js-subscriptions-methods).

```javascript ethers.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);

async function getFilterChanges(filter) {
  try {
    const changes = await provider.send('eth_getFilterChanges', [filter]);
    console.log(changes); // Log the with the new data
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err); // Handle errors that may occur
  }
}

const filterId =  '0x4e7ef166cd43f188b0f8f9e218966a8f' //'YOUR_FILTER_iD'
getFilterChanges(filterId)
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3  
node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL" 
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url))

def get_filtered_events(filter_id):
    try:
        filter_changes = web3.eth.get_filter_changes(filter_id)
        print(filter_changes) # the array of events that match the filter
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

filter_id = '0x0'
get_filtered_events(filter_id)       
```
</CodeGroup>


## Use case

The `eth_getFilterChanges` method can poll a filter to periodically retrieve new data. You can, for example, create a blocks filter using [eth\_newBlockFilter](/api-reference/aurora_node_api/eth_newBlockFilter) and periodically poll it to get new blocks.
