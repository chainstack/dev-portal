## Use case

The `slotUnsubscribe` method is important for proper resource management in applications that use slot subscriptions. Common use cases include:

* Cleanup: Remove slot subscriptions when monitoring is no longer needed
* Resource management: Free up system resources by unsubscribing from unused slot notifications
* Connection handling: Clean up subscriptions during application shutdown or WebSocket disconnections
* Subscription rotation: Remove old subscriptions when establishing new ones

By properly managing slot subscriptions through unsubscribe calls, applications can maintain optimal performance and prevent resource leaks.
