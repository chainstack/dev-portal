* `filter` - An object or string specifying the type of logs to receive:

  * `"all"` - Subscribe to all logs (string)
  * `{mentions: [<string>]}` - An array of public keys as base-58 encoded strings. Returns notifications only when the specified account or program ID is mentioned in the log.

* `<commitment>` - (optional) The level of commitment desired when querying state. Default is "finalized".

## Response

* `result` - An integer subscription id (needed to unsubscribe)

* `subscription` - An object containing log information:

  * `signature` - The transaction signature as base-58 encoded string
  * `err` - Error if transaction failed, null if transaction succeeded
  * `logs` - Array of string log messages

## `logsSubscribe` code examples

This example subscribes to all logs from the [pump.fun program](https://solscan.io/account/6EF8rrecthR5Dkzon8Nwu78hRvfCKubJ14M5uBEwF6P).

<Info>
  Note that subscriptions require a WebSocket connection and [WebSocket cat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wscat) for you to use this method in the console.

  Install WebSocket cat with:

  `npm install -g wscat`

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell wscat
  $ wscat -c YOUR_CHAINSTACK_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT
  # Wait for the connection to be established

  Connected (press CTRL+C to quit)
