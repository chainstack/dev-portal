title: "Executing transactions | Avalanche"
description: "The executing transactions methods provide developers with a flexible set of tools for interacting with the Avalanche network. Specifically, these methods can be used to execute function calls on smart contracts, sign transactions with a private key, and submit signed transactions to the network for execution. This enables developers to build a wide range of decentralized applications, including wallets, exchanges, and other tools for interacting with the Avalanche network. These methods can be particularly useful for testing, offline transaction signing, and programmatic interaction with the network."
