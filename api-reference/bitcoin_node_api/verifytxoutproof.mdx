## Parameters

* `proof` (required): The proof of inclusion for a transaction in a block, typically a merkle branch in hexadecimal format.

## Response

* `result` — an array of transaction IDs that were included in the proof if it is valid.
* `error` — an object containing an error message if an error occurred, otherwise `null`.
* `id` — an integer representing the ID of the request.

## Use case

The `verifytxoutproof` method is useful for verifying that a particular transaction was included in a block without needing the entire block data. This is particularly useful for lightweight clients and applications that need to verify transaction inclusion efficiently.
