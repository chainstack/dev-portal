## Parameters

* `height` (required) — the height of the block whose hash should be returned

## Response

* `result` — a string representing the hash of the block at the given height
* `error` — an object containing an error message if an error occurred, otherwise `null`
* `id` — an integer representing the ID of the request, used to match requests with responses

## Use case

The `getblockhash` method is useful for retrieving the hash of a block at a specific height in the blockchain. This can be used in conjunction with other methods like `getblock` to retrieve detailed information about a particular block.

For example, a block explorer application might use `getblockhash` to get the hash of the latest block, and then use that hash with `getblock` to retrieve and display the contents of the latest block.
