## Parameters

* `blockhash` (required) — the hash of the block
* `filtertype` (required) — the type of filter to retrieve, currently only `basic` is supported

## Response

* `result` — an object containing the block filter with the following fields:
  + `filter` — the hex-encoded filter data
  + `header` — the hex-encoded filter header
* `error` — an object containing an error message if an error occurred, otherwise `null`
* `id` — an integer representing the ID of the request, used to match requests with responses

## Use case

Block filters are used to efficiently determine if a block may contain transactions relevant to a particular wallet or light client without downloading the entire block. The `getblockfilter` method allows retrieving these filters for a specific block.

For example, a light wallet might use `getblockfilter` to check if it needs to download a particular block to search for wallet transactions, reducing bandwidth and processing requirements compared to downloading every block.
