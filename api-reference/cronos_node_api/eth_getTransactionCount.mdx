title: eth_getTransactionCount | Cronos
openapi: /openapi/cronos_node_api/eth_getTransactionCount.json POST /b9b0fb92029d58b396139a9e89cf479b
---

Cronos API method that returns the number of transactions sent from an address at the selected block. This value is also called `nonce`; it is an important piece of information, especially to ensure that a transaction is not sent twice.

## Parameters

* `address`— the address to retrieve the transaction count.
* `quantity or tag` — the integer of a block encoded as hexadecimal or the string with:

  + `latest` — the most recent block in the blockchain and the current state of the blockchain at the most recent block. A chain reorganization is to be expected.
  + `safe` — the block that received justification from the beacon chain. Although this block could be involved in a chain reorganization, it would necessitate either a coordinated attack by the majority of validators or an instance of severe propagation latency.
  + `finalized` — the block accepted as canonical by more than 2/3 of the validators. A chain reorganization is extremely unlikely, and it would require at least 1/3 of the staked amount to be burned.
  + `earliest` — the earliest available or genesis block.
  + `pending` — the pending state and transactions block. The current state of transactions that have been broadcast to the network but have not yet been included in a block.

<Note>
See the [default block parameter](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block) and [How The Merge Impacts Ethereum’s Application Layer](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer).
</Note>


## Response

* `quantity` — an integer value identifying the number of transactions sent from an address at the specified block.

```javascript web3.js
const { Web3 } = require("web3");
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

async function getTransactionsCount(address, blockId) {
  const count = await web3.eth.getTransactionCount(address, blockId)
  console.log(count);
}

getTransactionsCount("0xc37D7385c4A717636E12ad985daF883E2d5869D5", 'latest')
```

```javascript ethers.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);

const getNonce = async (address, blockId) => {
    const nonce = await provider.send("eth_getTransactionCount", [address, blockId]);
    console.log(nonce);
  };

  getNonce("0xc37D7385c4A717636E12ad985daF883E2d5869D5", "latest")
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3  
node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL" 

web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url)) 
print(web3.eth.get_transaction_count("0xc37D7385c4A717636E12ad985daF883E2d5869D5", "latest")) 
```

## Use case

One of the most common use cases for `eth_getTransactionCount`is to create the transaction object built in a script designed to send a transaction. The nonce field is required, and it is retrieved using the `eth_getTransactionCount` method.
