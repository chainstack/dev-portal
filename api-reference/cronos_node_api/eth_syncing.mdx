title: eth_syncing | Cronos
openapi: /openapi/cronos_node_api/eth_syncing.json POST /b9b0fb92029d58b396139a9e89cf479b
---

Cronos API method that returns an object with information about the current synchronization status of the node, or `false` if the node is fully synced. This method can track the progress of a node's synchronization with the Cronos blockchain. The returned object contains data such as the starting block, current block, and highest block of the node, allowing developers to monitor and estimate the time remaining for the node to sync fully.

## Parameters

* `none`

## Response

* `result` — the boolean value `false` when not syncing or a JSON object when syncing:
  + `startingBlock` — the block number where the synchronization process started, encoded as hexadecimal.
  + `currentBlock` — the block number that the node has currently processed, same as `eth_blockNumber`, encoded as hexadecimal.
  + `highestBlock` — the block number of the latest block in the blockchain known to the node.

## `eth_syncing` code examples

<CodeGroup>
```javascript web3.js
const { Web3 } = require("web3");
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

async function syncStatus() {
  const status = await web3.eth.isSyncing();
  console.log(status)
}

syncStatus()
```

```javascript ethers.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);

const syncStatus = async () => {
    const status = await provider.send("eth_syncing", []);
     console.log(status);
   };

syncStatus();
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3  
node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL" 
print (web3.eth.syncing) 
```

## Use case

The `eth_syncing` method can be useful for developers building applications that interact with the Cronos blockchain. For example, you may want to provide feedback to your application's user about the status of the node the application is connecting to.
