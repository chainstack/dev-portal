title: arbtrace_call | Arbitrum
openapi: /openapi/arbitrum_node_api/debug_and_trace/arbtrace_call.json POST /66f812de2a6724a75a51f60dd6f2a154
---

Arbitrum API method that traces the execution of [eth\_call](/api-reference/arbitrum_node_api/execute_transactions/eth_call) within the context of a specific block's execution. This method uses the final state of the parent block as its base and allows developers to trace the execution of a particular call.

<Note>
Learn how to [deploy a node](/docs/debug-and-trace-apis#ethereum) with the debug and trace API methods enabled.
</Note>

<Warning>
Blocks older than 22,207,815th were added to the chain before Nitro migration and cannot be queried with Geth methods. Starting from block 22,207,815, Arbitrum migrated to Nitro which made Geth `debug_*` methods available for newer blocks.

Use the `arbtrace_call` method for calling blocks prior to 22,207,815.

## Parameters

* `object` — the transaction call object:

  + `from` — (optional) the string of the address used to send the transaction.
  + `to` — the string of the address to which the transaction is directed, a wallet, or a smart contract.
  + `gas` — (optional) the maximum amount of gas that can be used by the transaction.
  + `gasprice` — (optional) the amount of gas price the sender is willing to pay for each gas unit in [wei](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ether/#denominations).
  + `value` — (optional) the value sent with this transaction, encoded as hexadecimal.
  + `data` — (optional) additional data to be sent with the call, usually used to invoke functions from smart contracts as a string of the hash of the method signature and encoded parameters; see the [Ethereum Contract ABI](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/abi-spec.html).
* `quantity` — the integer of a block, encoded as hexadecimal.
* `array` — an array identifying the type of tracer and its configuration:

  + `trace` — tracer that captures information on all call frames executed during a transaction. The resulting nested list of call frames is organized into a tree structure that reflects the way the Ethereum Virtual Machine works and can be used for debugging and analysis purposes.

## Response

* `output` — the data returned as a result of the transaction, encoded in hexadecimal format.
* `stateDiff` — reveals changes to the state resulting from the execution of the given transaction.
* `trace` — the basic trace of specific information.
  + `action` — the operation to be performed on the recipient.
    - `from` — the address initiating the transaction.
    - `callType` — the type of method, such as `call` or `delegatecall`.
    - `gas` — the units of gas supplied by the sender, encoded in hexadecimal format.
    - `input` — the data transmitted along with the transaction, typically used for interaction with smart contracts.
    - `to` — the recipient's address. If it's a contract creation transaction, this field is `null`.
    - `value` — the amount sent with the transaction, encoded as a hexadecimal.
  + `result` — the value of the gas price used, encoded as hexadecimal.
    - `gasUsed` — the total amount of gas used by all the transactions in the block, encoded as hexadecimal.
    - `output` — the return value from the contract call, encoded in hexadecimal. If the `RETURN` method isn't executed, the output will be empty bytes.
  + `subtraces` — a list of contract calls made by the transaction, each represented as a nested `call`frame object.
  + `traceAddress` — a list of addresses where the call was executed, the addresses of the parent calls, and the order of the current sub-call.
  + `type` — the value of the method, such as `call` or `create`.
* `vmTrace` — a comprehensive trace of the virtual machine's state during the execution of a given transaction, including any sub-calls.
