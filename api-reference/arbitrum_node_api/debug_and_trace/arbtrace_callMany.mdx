title: arbtrace_callMany | Arbitrum
openapi: /openapi/arbitrum_node_api/debug_and_trace/arbtrace_callMany.json POST /66f812de2a6724a75a51f60dd6f2a154
---

Arbitrum API method that executes multiple call traces on the same block within the blockchain. Before executing a transaction, all preceding transactions are first applied and traced to ensure a clear, sequential record of transactions and their interdependencies. This allows for the tracing of dependent transactions and is essential for integrity and accountability.

<Note>
Learn how to [deploy a node](/docs/debug-and-trace-apis#arbitrum) with the debug and trace API methods enabled.
</Note>

<Warning>
Blocks older than 22,207,815th were added to the chain before Nitro migration and cannot be queried with Geth methods. Starting from block 22,207,815, Arbitrum migrated to Nitro which made Geth `debug_*` methods available for newer blocks.

Use the `arbtrace_callMany` method for calling blocks prior to 22,207,815.

## Parameters

* `array` — transaction call objects:
  + `object` — the transaction call object to trace; can be multiple call objects for different transactions:
    - `from` — (optional) the string of the address used to send the transaction.
    - `to` — the string of the address to which the transaction is directed, a wallet, or a smart contract.
    - `gas` — (optional) the maximum amount of gas that can be used by the transaction.
    - `gasprice` — (optional) the amount of gas price the sender is willing to pay for each gas unit in [wei](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ether/#denominations).
    - `value` — (optional) the value sent with this transaction, encoded as hexadecimal.
    - `data` — (optional) additional data to be sent with the call, usually used to invoke functions from smart contracts as a string of the hash of the method signature and encoded parameters; see the [Ethereum Contract ABI](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/abi-spec.html).
  + `array` — the string `trace` to indicate the type of tracer.
* `quantity` — the integer of a block, encoded as hexadecimal.

## Response

* `array` — an array with the traces objects:
  + `output` — the data returned as a result of the transaction, encoded in hexadecimal format.
  + `stateDiff` — reveals changes to the state resulting from the execution of the given transaction.
  + `trace` — the basic trace of specific information.
    - `action` — the operation to be performed on the recipient.
      * `from` — the address initiating the transaction.
      * `callType` — the type of method, such as `call` or `delegatecall`.
      * `gas` — the units of gas supplied by the sender, encoded in hexadecimal format.
      * `input` — the data transmitted along with the transaction, typically used for interaction with smart contracts.
      * `to` — the recipient's address. If it's a contract creation transaction, this field is `null`.
      * `value` — the amount sent with the transaction, encoded as a hexadecimal.
    - `result` — the value of the gas price used, encoded as hexadecimal.
      * `gasUsed` — the total amount of gas used by all the transactions in the block, encoded as hexadecimal.
      * `output` — the return value from the contract call, encoded in hexadecimal. If the `RETURN` method isn't executed, the output will be empty bytes.
    - `subtraces` — a list of contract calls made by the transaction, each represented as a nested `call`frame object.
    - `traceAddress` — a list of addresses where the call was executed, the addresses of the parent calls, and the order of the current sub-call.
    - `type` — the value of the method, such as `call` or `create`.
  + `vmTrace` — a comprehensive trace of the virtual machine's state during the execution of a given transaction, including any sub-calls.
