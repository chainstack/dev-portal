Arbitrum API method that replays all the transactions within a specific block and returns the traces. Developers can use the `arbtrace_replayBlockTransactions` method to gain insight into the behavior of smart contracts within a block, analyze gas usage, and optimize their contracts accordingly.

<Note>
Learn how to [deploy a node](/docs/debug-and-trace-apis#ethereum) with the debug and trace API methods enabled.

<Warning>
Blocks older than 22,207,815th were added to the chain before Nitro migration and cannot be queried with Geth methods. Starting from block 22,207,815, Arbitrum migrated to Nitro which made Geth `debug_*` methods available for newer blocks.

Use the `arbtrace_replayBlockTransactions` method for calling blocks prior to 22,207,815.

## Parameters

* `quantity` — the integer of a block, encoded as hexadecimal or the string.
* `array` — an array identifying the type of tracer and its configuration:

  + `trace` — tracer that captures information on all call frames executed during a transaction. The resulting nested list of call frames is organized into a tree structure that reflects the way the Ethereum Virtual Machine works and can be used for debugging and analysis purposes.

## Response

* `output` — the data returned as a result of the transaction, encoded in hexadecimal format.
* `stateDiff` — reveals changes to the state resulting from the execution of the given transaction.
* `trace` — the basic trace of specific information.
  + `action` — the operation to be performed on the recipient.
    - `from` — the address initiating the transaction.
    - `callType` — the type of method, such as `call` or `delegatecall`.
    - `gas` — the units of gas supplied by the sender, encoded in hexadecimal format.
    - `input` — the data transmitted along with the transaction, typically used for interaction with smart contracts.
    - `to` — the recipient's address. If it's a contract creation transaction, this field is `null`.
    - `value` — the amount sent with the transaction, encoded as a hexadecimal.
  + `result` — the value of the gas price used, encoded as hexadecimal.
    - `gasUsed` — the total amount of gas used by all the transactions in the block, encoded as hexadecimal.
    - `output` — the return value from the contract call, encoded in hexadecimal. If the `RETURN` method isn't executed, the output will be empty bytes.
  + `subtraces` — a list of contract calls made by the transaction, each represented as a nested `call`frame object.
  + `traceAddress` — a list of addresses where the call was executed, the addresses of the parent calls, and the order of the current sub-call.
  + `type` — the value of the method, such as `call` or `create`.
* `vmTrace` — a comprehensive trace of the virtual machine's state during the execution of a given transaction, including any sub-calls.
* `destroyedContracts` — a list of the smart contract destroyed during the block execution; `null` if no contract was destroyed.

```javascript web3.js
const Web3 = require("web3");
const NODE_URL = "YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT";
const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

// Define the arbtrace_get custom method
web3.extend({
    property: 'arbtrace',
    methods: [{
      name: 'replayBlockTransactions',
      call: 'arbtrace_replayBlockTransactions',
      params: 2,
    }],
  });
  
  async function replayBlockTransactions() {
    const block = "0x152dd46";
    const traceOptions = ["trace"];
  
    try {
      const result = await web3.arbtrace.replayBlockTransactions(block, traceOptions);
      console.log(result);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error:", error);
    }
  }
  
  replayBlockTransactions();

```javascript ethers.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = "YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);

    const block = '0x152dd46'
    const tracer = 'trace';

    const traces = await provider.send("arbtrace_replayBlockTransactions", [block, [tracer]]);

## Use case

The `arbtrace_replayBlockTransactions` allows you to replay the transactions within a specific block and retrieve detailed execution traces for each transaction. It is particularly useful for analyzing the state changes and interactions that occurred during the execution of transactions within a block.

Here are the key points to understand about the `arbtrace_replayBlockTransactions` method:

* Retrieving execution traces — the method replays the transactions within a block and returns execution traces for each transaction. These traces provide a detailed account of the state changes, internal transactions, and events triggered during the execution.
* Block-level analysis — the method focuses on a specific block and replays all the transactions within that block. It is different from individual transaction tracing methods, as it provides a comprehensive view of the interactions and effects of multiple transactions within a single block.
* Contextual understanding — by using `arbtrace_replayBlockTransactions`, developers can gain a deeper understanding of the sequence and effects of transactions within a block. This can be valuable for debugging complex interactions, analyzing reentrancy issues, or understanding the overall impact of transactions on the blockchain state.
