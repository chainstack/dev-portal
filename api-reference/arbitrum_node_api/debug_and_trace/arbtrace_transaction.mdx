Arbitrum API method that traces a specific transaction. It provides a detailed record of all the steps taken by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) during the execution, including all the operations performed and the changes made to the blockchain state.

<Note>
Learn how to [deploy a node](/docs/debug-and-trace-apis#ethereum) with the debug and trace API methods enabled.

<Warning>
Blocks older than 22,207,815th were added to the chain before Nitro migration and cannot be queried with Geth methods. Starting from block 22,207,815, Arbitrum migrated to Nitro which made Geth `debug_*` methods available for newer blocks.

Use the `arbtrace_transaction` method for calling blocks prior to 22,207,815.

## Parameters

* `hash` — the hash identifying a transaction

## Response

* `action` — an object that describes the action taken by the transaction:
  + `from` — the address of the sender who initiated the transaction.
  + `callType` — the type of call, `call` or `delegatecall`, two ways to invoke a function in a smart contract. `call` creates a new environment for the function to work in, so changes made in that function won't affect the environment where the function was called. `delegatecall` doesn't create a new environment. Instead, it runs the function within the environment of the caller, so changes made in that function will affect the caller's environment.
  + `gas` — the units of gas included in the transaction by the sender.
  + `input` — the optional input data sent with the transaction, usually used to interact with smart contracts.
  + `to` — the address of the recipient of the transaction if it was a transaction to an address. For contract creation transactions, this field is null.
  + `value` — the value of the native token transferred along with the transaction, in wei.
  + `blockHash` — the hash of the block in which the transaction was included.
  + `blockNumber` — the number of the block in which the transaction was included.
  + `error` — a string that indicates whether the transaction was successful or not. `null` if successful, `Reverted` if not.
  + `result` — an object that contains additional data about the execution of the transaction:
    - `gasUsed` — the total used gas by the call, encoded as hexadecimal.
    - `output` — the return value of the call, encoded as a hexadecimal string.
  + `subtraces` — the number of sub-traces created during execution. When a transaction is executed on the EVM, it may trigger additional sub-executions, such as when a smart contract calls another smart contract or when an external account is accessed.
  + `traceAddress` — an array that indicates the position of the transaction in the trace.
  + `transactionHash` — the hash of the transaction.
  + `transactionPosition` — the position of the transaction in the block.
  + `type` — the type of action taken by the transaction, `call` or `create`. `call`  is the most common type of trace and occurs when a smart contract invokes another contract's function. `create` represents the creation of a new smart contract. This type of trace occurs when a smart contract is deployed to the blockchain.

```javascript web3.js
const Web3 = require("web3");
const NODE_URL = "YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT";
const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

// Define the arbtrace_transaction custom method
web3.extend({

  }]
});

async function traceTransaction(txHash) {
    const result = await web3.debug.traceTransaction(txHash);
    console.log(result);

traces = web3.provider.make_request('arbtrace_transaction', [tx_hash])
print(traces)

## Use case

The `arbtrace_transaction` method in Arbitrum is useful for debugging and analyzing transactions on the blockchain. It allows developers to trace the execution of a specific transaction and retrieve detailed information about its steps, contract calls, state changes, and gas consumption.

Analyzing the trace helps developers identify the specific step or contract interaction where the issue occurs. With this information, they can debug and resolve the problem, whether it's a logical error, incorrect input values, or unexpected interactions with other contracts.
