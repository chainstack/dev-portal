## Parameters

* `hash` — the hash of the block
* `boolean` — if `true`, it returns the details of each transaction. If `false`, only the hashes of the transactions.

## Response

* `object` — block object, or `null` when no block was found.
  + `number` — the block number of the requested block, encoded as hexadecimal. `null` if the block is pending.
  + `hash` — the block hash of the requested block. `null` if the block is pending.
  + `parenthash` — the previous block's hash used to generate the current block. Also known as the 'parent block'.
  + `nonce` — the hash used to demonstrate proof-of-work. `null` if the block is pending. It returns `0x0000000000000000` when the consensus is proof-of-stake.
  + `sha3uncles` — the hash of the list of uncles included in the block. It is used to identify the block uniquely and to verify the integrity of the block's data.
  + `logsbloom` — the bloom filter for the block logs, a data structure that allows for efficient membership testing of elements in a set, in this case, the logs included in the block. `null` if pending.
  + `transactionsroot` — the root of the transaction trie of the block. The `transactionsRoot` field allows nodes to verify the integrity of the transactions in a block.
  + `stateroot` — the root of the final state trie of the block. The `stateroot` field is included in the block header and is used to verify the integrity of the state at the time the block was processed
  + `receiptsroot`— the root of the block's receipts trie. This is a 32-byte hash of the root node of the receipts trie for all transactions in the block. It is used to verify the integrity of the receipt data for all transactions in the block.
  + `miner` — the address of the miner receiving the reward.
  + `difficulty` — a measure of how hard it is to find a valid block for the blockchain. It is a number that increases as more miners join the network and more blocks are added to the chain. Encoded as hexadecimal.
  + `totaldifficulty` — the cumulative sum of the difficulty of all blocks that have been mined in the network since the inception of the network. It measures the overall security and integrity of the network.
  + `extradata` — the extra data included in a block by the miner who mined it. It often includes messages or other information related to the block.
  + `size` — the size of this block in bytes as an integer value, encoded as hexadecimal.
  + `gaslimit` — the maximum gas allowed in this block, encoded as hexadecimal.
  + `gasused` — the total used gas by all transactions in this block, encoded as hexadecimal.
  + `timestamp` — the Unix timestamp for when the block was collated.
  + `transactions` — an array of transaction objects. See [eth\_getTransactionByHash](/api-reference/bnb_node_api/eth_getTransactionByHash) for the exact shape.
  + `uncles` — the array of uncle hashes.

## `eth_getBlockByHash` code examples

<CodeGroup>
```javascript web3.js
const { Web3 } = require("web3");
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

async function getBlock(blockHash) {
    const block = await web3.eth.getBlock(blockHash, false);
    console.log(block);
  }
  
getBlock("0x37ad71509d0ceec7c0297951f113012055ffa855998451f769a5d515327cb8bd")
```

```javascript ethers.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);

const eth_getBlockByHash = async () => {
    const blockByNumber = await provider.send("eth_getBlockByHash", ["0x37ad71509d0ceec7c0297951f113012055ffa855998451f769a5d515327cb8bd",false]);
     console.log(blockByNumber);
   };

eth_getBlockByHash();
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3

node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL"
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url))

# Block hash
block_hash = '0x37ad71509d0ceec7c0297951f113012055ffa855998451f769a5d515327cb8bd'

# Fetch the block by its hash
block = web3.eth.get_block(block_hash, False)

# Print block details (customize as per your needs)
print("Block Number:", block.number)
print("Block Timestamp:", block.timestamp)
print("Transactions in Block:", len(block.transactions))
```

## Use case

The `eth_getBlockByHash` is excellent for analytics purposes. For example, it can be used to quickly find out the hashes of transactions that create new smart contracts. The `transactions` field, an array of all the transactions within the block, is returned in the response. By iterating through this array and examining each transaction's `to` field, a user can determine which transactions in the block are creating new smart contracts.
