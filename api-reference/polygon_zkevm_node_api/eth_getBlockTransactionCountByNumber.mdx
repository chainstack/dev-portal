## Parameters

* `quantity or tag` — the integer of a block encoded as hexadecimal or the string with:

  + `latest` — the most recent block in the blockchain and the current state of the blockchain at the most recent block
  + `earliest` — the earliest available or genesis block
  + `pending`—the pending state and transactions block. This is the current state of transactions that have been broadcast to the network but have not yet been included in a block.

<Note>
See the [default block parameter](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#the-default-block-parameter).
</Note>


## Response

* `quantity` — an integer value representing how many transactions are included in the block.

```javascript web3.js
const { Web3 } = require("web3");
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

async function getTransactionsCount(blockId) {
  const count = await web3.eth.getBlockTransactionCount(blockId)
  console.log(count);
}

getTransactionsCount('latest')
```

```javascript ethers.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);

const getTransactionsCount = async (blockId) => {
    const count = await provider.send("eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber", [blockId]);
     console.log(count);
   };

   getTransactionsCount('latest')
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3  
node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL" 

web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url)) 
print (web3.eth.get_block_transaction_count(37278959)) # A hex value starting with "0x" is accepted as well.
```

## Use case

`eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber` can be used to analyze how many transactions are included on the Polygon zkEVM blockchain in a certain period. For instance, on average, a new block is generated on the zkEVM mainnet every 3 seconds, resulting in approximately 1,200 blocks per hour. Using a Web3 library, one can inspect the past 1,00 blocks starting from the latest block and use `eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber` to find the number of transactions in each block to sum them.
