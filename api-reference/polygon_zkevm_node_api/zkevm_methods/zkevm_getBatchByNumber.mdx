## Parameters

* `batchNumber` — an integer or hexadecimal string representing the batch number.

## Response

* `number` — a hexadecimal value representing the batch number.
* `coinbase` — the address of the sequencer that virtualized this batch, for now, it refers to the Trusted Sequencer address.
* `stateRoot` — the root of the final state of the batch.
* `globalExitRoot` — the root of the tree that represents the deposits of the bridge (multichain). Root containing all the local exit roots of all the connected networks (in this case, a local exit root for L1 and another for L2).
* `localExitRoot` — the root of the tree that represents the deposits of the zkEVM.
* `accInputHash` — the hash of the inputs used to build the zero-knowledge proof for a batch. Also included in the input is the `accInputHash` from the previous batch, used for the aggregation of zero-knowledge proofs.
* `timestamp` — the hexadecimal value of the Unix timestamp representing the exact time of the batch being verified.
* `sendSequencesTxHash` — the hash of the transaction that virtualized this batch. `null` when it's not virtualized yet.
* `verifyBatchTxHash` — the hash of the transaction that verified this batch. `null` when it's not verified yet.
* `transactions[]` — an array of hashes of all the transactions included in the batch.
