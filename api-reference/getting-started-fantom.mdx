## What is the Fantom Chain?

Fantom Chain is a high-performance, scalable, and secure smart-contract platform designed to overcome the limitations of previous-generation blockchains. Launched in 2019, Fantom aims to provide a decentralized and open-source environment for developers to build highly scalable decentralized applications (DApps) and digital assets.

The core of Fantom's innovation lies in its consensus mechanism, the Lachesis Protocol, a variant of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology. This allows for near-instant transaction confirmation and significantly lowers transaction costs compared to traditional blockchains. Fantom is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling developers to deploy Ethereum-based DApps and smart contracts on a more scalable network.

Discover a range of Fantom Chain tools in the [Fantom Chain tooling](/docs/fantom-tooling) section.

## What is the Fantom Chain API?

The Fantom Chain API enables developers to interact with the Fantom Chain blockchain, facilitating the development and management of decentralized applications.

Chainstack Fantom Chain nodes offer access to the Fantom Chain API, adhering to the Ethereum JSON-RPC specification. This compatibility ensures developers can query data from and submit transactions to the Fantom Chain as easily as they would with Ethereum-based projects.

Applications need to implement the JSON-RPC protocol to communicate with a Fantom Chain RPC node, which allows for remote procedure calls as though they were local.

## How to start using the Fantom Chain API

Accessing the Fantom Chain API requires a connection to a Fantom RPC node.

Follow these steps to sign up on Chainstack, deploy a Fantom RPC node, and obtain your endpoint credentials:

<Steps>
<Step>
[Sign up with Chainstack](https://console.fantom.foundation/user/account/create).
</Step>
<Step>
[Deploy a node](/docs/manage-your-networks#join-a-public-network).
</Step>
<Step>
[View node access and credentials](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).
</Step>
</Steps>
Once you complete these steps, you're ready to connect to the Fantom blockchain and start building with the Fantom Chain API.
