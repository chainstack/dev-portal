title: Ethereum API Postman collection
---

Here you will have access to a Postman collection to test the Ethereum API methods using your Ethereum Chainstack endpoint.

## What is Postman?

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a popular collaboration platform for developers that simplifies the process of building, testing, and documenting APIs. It allows developers to send HTTP requests and receive responses in a user-friendly interface, making it easy to debug and test APIs.

This collection allows you to test Ethereum RPC methods using your Chainstack node conveniently.

## Test Ethereum RPC methods in Postman

You can test your Ethereum Chainstack endpoint with the following Postman collection.

### Run the collection

1. Click **Run in Postman**.

   [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/20722034-40a9d0ed-fe75-4900-b249-5464c1422f96?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D20722034-40a9d0ed-fe75-4900-b249-5464c1422f96%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3Df1ba12a1-51de-4de6-8a9e-97b26ce685e0#?env%5BPublic-collection%5D=W10=)
2. Click **Fork collection** and follow the steps to set it up in your environment.
3. After the collection is set up, select a method to test, for example, `eth_chainId`.
4. Hover over `{{YOUR_CHAINSTACK_ENDPOINT}}` and click **Add new variable**.
5. Add your Chainstack node endpoint to the **Value** field, and select the collection as the **Scope**.

Now your Chainstack endpoint is available for every method. Edit the **Body** parameters if you need and send the request using the **Send** button.
