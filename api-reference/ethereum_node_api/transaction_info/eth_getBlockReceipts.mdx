title: eth_getBlockReceipts | Ethereum
---

Ethereum API method that retrieves all transaction receipts for a given block. Transaction receipts contain information about the execution status of a transaction and can be useful for monitoring the status of transfers or contract execution on the blockchain.

<Note>
This method is available on both the Geth and Erigon clients.

## Parameters

* `quantity or tag` — the integer of a block encoded as hexadecimal or the string with:

  + `latest` — the most recent block in the blockchain and the current state of the blockchain at the most recent block. A chain reorganization is to be expected.
  + `safe` — the block that received justification from the beacon chain. Although this block could be involved in a chain reorganization, it would necessitate either a coordinated attack by the majority of validators or an instance of severe propagation latency.
  + `finalized` — the block accepted as canonical by more than 2/3 of the validators. A chain reorganization is extremely unlikely, and it would require at least 1/3 of the staked ETH to be burned.
  + `earliest` — the earliest available or genesis block
  + `pending` — the pending state and transactions block. The current state of transactions that have been broadcast to the network but have not yet been included in a block.

<Note>
See the [default block parameter](https://https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block.wiki/json-rpc/API#the-default-block-parameter) and [How The Merge Impacts Ethereum’s Application Layer](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer).
</Note>


## Response

* `result` — an array of objects with the following fields:
  + `Transaction receipt` — the object with:
    - `blockHash` — the block hash. Identifies the block in which the transaction was included. This field is `null` for transactions that have not yet been included in a block.
    - `blockNumber` — the number of the block in which the transaction was included. This field is `null` for transactions that have not yet been included in a block.
    - `contractAddress` — the address of the contract created by the transaction if it was a contract creation transaction. Otherwise, the value is `null`.
    - `cumulativeGasUsed` — the total amount of gas used in the block until this transaction was executed.
    - `effectiveGasPrice` — the actual value deducted from the sender's account for this transaction.
    - `from` — the address of the sender who initiated the transaction.
    - `gasUsed` — the amount of gas used by this specific transaction alone.
    - `logs` — an array of log objects generated by this transaction, if any. Logs are generated by smart contracts.
    - `logsBloom` — the bloom filter used by light clients to quickly retrieve logs related to the transaction.
    - `status` — the success status of the transaction, represented as `1` for success or `0` for failure.
    - `to` — the address of the recipient of the transaction if it was a transaction to an address. For contract creation transactions, this field is `null`.
    - `transactionHash` — the hash that uniquely identifies the transaction.
    - `transactionIndex` — the index of the transaction within the block.
    - `type` — the [type](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/#types-of-transactions) of the transaction. `0` indicates a regular transfer; `2` indicates a contract creation or smart contract function call.

```javascript ethers.js

// Create a ChainstackProvider instance for Ethereum mainnet
const chainstack = new ethers.ChainstackProvider("mainnet");

const eth_getBlockReceipts = async () => {
  const BlockReceipts = await chainstack.send("eth_getBlockReceipts", [
    "latest",
  ]);
  console.log(BlockReceipts);
};

eth_getBlockReceipts();

const { Web3, Web3PluginBase } = require('web3');

        console.log(receipts);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching block receipts:", error);
    }

// Call the function with "latest" block

## Use case

The `eth_getBlockReceipts` allows you to retrieve the receipts for all transactions in a specific block. A practical use case can be to retrieve all of the logs emitted from the transactions in a block. The method returns an array of transaction receipts containing information about the transaction and any logs generated due to the transaction execution, so the logs can be isolated.

<Note>
Read [Uncovering the power of eth\_getBlockReceipts](/docs/uncovering-the-power-of-ethgetblockreceipts) to learn more about transactions receipts and how to use the `eth_getBlockReceipts` method.
</Note>


Here is an example of how to use `eth_getBlockReceipts` in ethers.js using the `ChainstackProvider` to extract all of the logs in a specific block and return them in an array:

```javascript index.js
const ethers = require("ethers");

// Create a ChainstackProvider instance for Ethereum mainnet
const chainstack = new ethers.ChainstackProvider("mainnet");

async function retrieveTransactionLogs(blockNumber) {
  // Call the eth_getBlockReceipts method to retrieve the receipts for all transactions in the block
  let receipts = await chainstack.send("eth_getBlockReceipts", [blockNumber]);

  // Flatten the receipts array into a single array of logs
  let logs = receipts.flatMap((receipt) => receipt.logs);

  // Return the logs
  return logs;
}

// call retrieveTransactionLogs on the latest block of the chain
async function main() {
  const blockNumber = "latest";
  const logs = await retrieveTransactionLogs(blockNumber);
  console.log(logs);
}

main();
```


In this example, the `retrieveTransactionLogs` function takes a block identifier as an input and returns an array of logs. The function first calls the `eth_getBlockReceipts` method using the `provider.send` method and passes in the block identifier as an argument. The result is an array of receipts, then flattened into a single array of logs using the `flatMap` function.
