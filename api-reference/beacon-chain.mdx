## How to start using the Beacon Chain API

When you deploy a node with Chainstack, you get both the execution layer node endpoint and the consensus layer (aka Beacon Chain) node endpoint.

Follow these steps to sign up on Chainstack, deploy an Ethereum RPC node, and find your endpoint credentials (both execution layer and the Beacon Chain):

<Steps>
<Step>
[Sign up with Chainstack](https://console.chainstack.com/user/account/create).
</Step>
<Step>
[Deploy a node](/docs/manage-your-networks#join-a-public-network).
</Step>
<Step>
[View node access and credentials](/docs/manage-your-node#view-node-access-and-credentials).
</Step>
</Steps>

Now you are ready to connect to the Ethereum blockchain and use the Beacon Chain API to build.
