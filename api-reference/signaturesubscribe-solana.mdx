title: "signatureSubscribe | Solana"
description: "The `signatureSubscribe` method in Solana allows developers to receive real-time notifications about the status of a transaction signature. This subscription-based method provides updates when a transaction's status changes."
---

## Parameters

* `string` - Transaction signature to monitor, as base-58 encoded string

* `<config>` - (optional) Configuration object:

  * `commitment` - The level of commitment desired when querying state:

    * `"processed"` - Most recent block that has reached the node
    * `"confirmed"` - Block that has reached 1 confirmation by supermajority of the cluster
    * `"finalized"` - Block that has been finalized by supermajority of the cluster

  * `enableReceivedNotification` - (optional) Boolean to enable notifications when transaction is received by the node. Default: false

## Response

* `result` - An integer subscription id (needed to unsubscribe)

* `subscription` - An object containing signature status:

  * `err` - Error if transaction failed, null if transaction succeeded

  * `status` - Transaction status:

    * `"received"` - Transaction received by node (if enableReceivedNotification is enabled)
    * `"processed"` - Transaction has been processed
    * `"confirmed"` - Transaction has been confirmed
    * `"finalized"` - Transaction has been finalized

  * `confirmations` - Number of blocks since transaction was processed (null if finalized)

  * `confirmationStatus` - The transaction's cluster confirmation status:

    * `"processed"` - Transaction landed in a block
    * `"confirmed"` - Transaction confirmed by supermajority
    * `"finalized"` - Transaction finalized by supermajority

## `signatureSubscribe` code examples

This example subscribes to updates for a specific transaction signature.

<Info>
  Note that subscriptions require a WebSocket connection and [WebSocket cat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wscat) for you to use this method in the console.

  Install WebSocket cat with:

  `npm install -g wscat`
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell wscat
  $ wscat -c YOUR_CHAINSTACK_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT
  # Wait for the connection to be established

  Connected (press CTRL+C to quit)

## Use case

The `signatureSubscribe` method is essential for applications that need to track transaction status. Common use cases include:

* Transaction monitoring: Track the status of sent transactions in real-time
* Payment processing: Monitor payment transactions for confirmation and finality
* User experience: Provide immediate feedback to users about their transaction status
* Error handling: Detect and respond to failed transactions quickly
* Confirmation tracking: Track the number of confirmations for critical transactions

By subscribing to signature updates, applications can provide real-time transaction status updates and implement robust error handling for failed transactions.
