title: eth_getProof | Fantom
openapi: /openapi/fantom_node_api/eth_getProof.json POST /4ab982aa70a7baead515ffdb5915df3f
---

Fantom API method that returns a Merkle proof for a specific account, contract storage, or both for a given block. Merkle proofs enable users to verify the existence and authenticity of data within a Merkle trie, a data structure that helps optimize and secure data retrieval in blockchains.

<Note>
**No longer supported**

The Sonic node client no longer supports `eth_getProof` for the Fantom chain. [See GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Fantom-foundation/Sonic/issues/379).

## Parameters

* `address` — Ethereum address of the account for which the proof is requested.
* `array` — the array of 32-byte storage keys that need to be proven and included. See [eth\_getStorageAt](/api-reference/fantom_node_api/eth_getStorageAt).
* `quantity or tag` — the integer of a block encoded as hexadecimal or the string with:

  + `latest` — the most recent block in the blockchain and the current state of the blockchain at the most recent block. A chain reorganization is to be expected.
  + `safe` — the block that received justification from the beacon chain. Although this block could be involved in a chain reorganization, it would necessitate either a coordinated attack by the majority of validators or an instance of severe propagation latency.
  + `finalized` — the block accepted as canonical by more than 2/3 of the validators. A chain reorganization is extremely unlikely, and it would require at least 1/3 of the staked ETH to be burned.
  + `earliest` — the earliest available or genesis block.
  + `pending` — the pending state and transactions block. The current state of transactions that have been broadcast to the network but have not yet been included in a block.

<Note>
See the [default block parameter](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block) and [How The Merge Impacts Ethereum’s Application Layer](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer).
</Note>


## Response

* `balance` — represents the account balance. Refer to [eth\_getBalance](/api-reference/fantom_node_api/eth_getBalance).
* `codeHash` — indicates the code hash associated with the account. For a simple account without any code, the value will be `0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470`.
* `nonce` — refers to the account's nonce. See [eth\_getTransactionCount](/api-reference/fantom_node_api/eth_getTransactionCount).
* `storageHash` — represents the SHA3 hash of the StorageRoot. All storage data will provide a Merkle proof that starts with this `rootHash`. This hash serves as the starting point for obtaining a Merkle proof for all storage entries linked to the account.
* `accountProof` — an array of RLP-serialized Merkle trie nodes, starting with the `stateRoot` node and following the path of the SHA3 (address) as the key, which can be used to verify the existence and authenticity of data within the trie.
* `storageProof` — contains the requested storage entries in an array, with each entry being an object that includes the following properties:
  + `key` — the requested storage key
  + `value`— the value associated with the storage key
  + `proof` — an array of RLP-serialized Merkle trie nodes, starting with the `storageHash` node and following the path of the SHA3 (key), which can be used to verify the existence and authenticity of data within the trie.

## Use case

A use case for the `eth_getProof` method can be when a decentralized application (DApp) interacts with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The DApp needs to verify the state of the contract's storage variables without downloading the entire blockchain data. By using `eth_getProof`, the DApp can request Merkle proof for specific storage slots in the contract. This proof can then be used to cryptographically verify the authenticity and accuracy of the storage data, ensuring the DApp is working with the correct contract state.
