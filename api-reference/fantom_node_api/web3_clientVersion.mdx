## `web3_clientVersion` code examples

<CodeGroup>
```javascript web3.js
const { Web3 } = require("web3");
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const web3 = new Web3(NODE_URL);

async function getClient() {
  const client = await web3.eth.getNodeInfo();
  console.log(client);
}

getClient();
```

```javascript ethers.js
const ethers = require('ethers');
const NODE_URL = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(NODE_URL);

const clientVersion = async () => {
  const version = await provider.send("web3_clientVersion");
  console.log(`Client version: ${version}`);
};

clientVersion();
```

```python web3.py
from web3 import Web3  
node_url = "CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL"
web3 = Web3.HTTPProvider(node_url)

client_version = web3.provider.make_request('web3_clientVersion', [])
print(client_version)

## Use case

A use case for the `web3_clientVersion` method can be to verify which client is running to then decide which method to run.

Let's say you have a DApp that needs to retrieve all of the transaction receipts in a block; the Erigon client has a method for this, `eth_getBlockReceipts`, but with Geth, this method is only available starting from V1.13.0. You can use the `web3_clientVersion` method in your logic to identify which client you are using to see if you have the method available.

<Note>
Read [Expanding your blockchain horizons: The eth\_getBlockReceipts emulator](/docs/expanding-your-blockchain-horizons-the-eth_getblockreceipts-emulator) to learn how to build a program to emulate `eth_getBlockReceipts` on any EVM-compatible chain.
