## What is the Ronin protocol?

Ronin is an EVM blockchain crafted for developers building games with player-owned economies. Ronin is conceptualized and implemented by Sky Mavis, the creators of Axie Infinity.

## What is the Ronin API

The Ronin API allows developers to communicate with the Ronin blockchain to build applications.

To read data from and send transactions to the Ronin blockchain, an application must connect to a Ronin RPC node.

When communicating with a Ronin RPC node, the Ronin client implements a JSON-RPC specification, a communication protocol allowing one to make remote calls and execute them as if they were made locally.

## How to start using the Ronin API

To use the Ronin API, you need access to a Ronin RPC node.

Follow these steps to sign up on Chainstack, deploy a Ronin RPC node, and find your endpoint credentials:
